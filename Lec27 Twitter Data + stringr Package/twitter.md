Mining Twitter Data
========================================================
[Beer vs church map](http://www.floatingsheep.org/2012/07/church-or-beer-americans-on-twitter.html)

What is the **most** important thing to keep in mind when observing such maps?



Mining Twitter Data
========================================================

**Strong** selection biases at every step:

* Who signs up to Twitter
* Who tweets at all
* Who tweets about these topics
* Who lets their location be revealed

i.e. the sample is non-random, so it is not representative of the population as a whole, and hence the results of the sample
are **not generalizable** to the entire US population.



However...
========================================================

George Box, one of the most famous statisticians said:  **All models are wrong, but some are useful.**

Create Twitter OAS Authentication
========================================================

We are getting digital permission to open the Twitter pipeline for our use, just like any other developer.

* Install `twitteR` package from RStudio (homepage is [here](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR))
* Create a Twitter application at the [Twitter developers page](http://dev.twitter.com).
* Make sure to give the app read, write and direct message authority.
* Note your "API key", "API secret", "Access token", and "Access token secret".  Do not share these with anyone nor save them in a publicly viewable file.





Handling Text in R
========================================================

Text is computer programming are called **(character) strings**.  Like handling dates, handling text is a non-sexy, but necessary, task.  The `stringr` package tries to alleviate this problem.

* Install the "current development version" of the package from [https://github.com/hadley/stringr](https://github.com/hadley/stringr) (not via the Packages window of RStudio)
* Open and knit `stringr_vignette.Rmd`



Today's Exercise
========================================================

* Make sure you can run `twitter.R` code.
* Getting familiar with all functions in the `stringr_vignette.Rmd` file.
* For each function, play with the Examples at the end of the help file.
* Things get tricky at the "Regular Expressions" section, so don't worry if things don't make complete sense just yet.
* Sorry, there is no cheatsheet for this package.
