Organic compounds are all about covalent bonds.

(And before some smart-ass ask what we call a compound with both covalent and ionic bonds ... the answer is synthetic.)",MagmaiKH,2014-12-17 22:43:24
"Covalent bonds aren't what define an organic compound - it's more that ""organic"" chemistry encompasses a huge class of naming rules, reaction patterns, and funky quantum electronic interactions, and these happen to occur with carbon but nothing else. Since carbon forms covalent bonds, organic chemistry only involves covalent bonds. However, carbon can exist in polyatomic ions and in covalent compounds that don't really fit into the organic system. Things like diamond, calcium carbonate (chalk) and silicon carbide, for example. Calcium carbonate is an ionic compound, but carbonate ion has covalent bonds - yet we would not call it organic. Diamond is 100% covalent bonds, but we typically don't call it organic. Graphite and fullerenes are 100% carbon, 100% covalent, but we *do* call them organic (sometimes).

It's not a very clear definition, unfortunately. I think of it, like I said, as whether or not it fits within the organic ""system"" - if you need to take an organic chemistry class or read an organic chemistry book in order to understand how to name it or how it will react, then it's ""organic.""",6thReplacementMonkey,2014-12-18 07:17:37
"Well, yeah, it's kinda arbitrary to different between inorganic carbon compounds and organic compounds, but the reason why some are called organic and calcium carbonate, for example, is not, is actually historical. Most carbon compounds are in the solutions as ions and also a lot of chemical properties of some organic molecules is because of shared covalent bonds. It's basically a definition thing that doesn't give us anything. Some scientist say that there must be C-H, some say C-C, some say that just carbon. It's not all about covalent bounds, there are metallo organic compounds.  It's true that usually there are no ionic bounds in organic compunds, but that's not always the case. It's never *that* simple in chemistry. Organical chemistry, the word organic in front of it, it mistakes people. There's almost nothing organic about organic chemistry. It comes from the time, when some German dude synthesized urea, an surely organic compound, from inorganic stuff and people thought that organic substances are only found in living organisms. Sorry, it's been quite a few years from the time I studied organic chemistry and also English is not my native language. Also synthetic...

"No - that is not why it's so harmful. In fact, it's so useful because it *doesn't* react with much. It is harmful because it is an inorganic solvent that is very small and can pass through skin easily. It is not easily broken down in the environment or in your body, but it can find its way to the proteins and DNA and interfere with them.

Proteins and DNA (and RNA) all depend on their shape for their functionality. Their shape is dependent on the balance between hydrophobic forces within the molecule and hydrophilic forces between the molecule and the surrounding water. When you put a hydrophobic solvent into the mix (like benzene) that balance is disrupted, and as a result, the proteins/DNA/RNA can change shape. Sometimes that has no effect, sometimes it messes up DNA replication and gives you cancer.

So, benzene is ""bad"" because it persists in organisms and the environment (although it's not as bad in that sense as a lot of chemicals) and it can give you cancer (although as far as carcinogens go, it's not real high up on the list)",6thReplacementMonkey,2014-12-18 07:22:53
Thanks for the informative correction!,PM_ur_Rump,2014-12-18 12:04:59
"It is probably benzene, and it's always 6-sided. It's actually not in much anymore, because it is a carcinogen, and there are a lot of alternatives that work better (or almost as well) and that aren't. Although some of the alternatives have other bad effects.

The key feature of benzene is that it is an aromatic ring - meaning it has double bonds all around it (pi-bonds). That makes it very stable, as well as making it a great hydrophobic solvent.",6thReplacementMonkey,2014-12-18 07:24:53

"In regards to anaerobic bacteria, they generally follow a pretty characterized redox cascade when oxygen is no longer available (function of their respective free energy for the reactions). If you base it solely on major metabolic respiration reactions... the general cascade you would observe in, say, deep ocean sediments (presuming availability of all oxidants for each reaction to occur) would be as follows:

*Denitrification (deltaG ~ -2660, compared to oxygen's -2820); requires nitrate; yields nitrogen gas, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and water. 

*Manganese reduction (deltaG ~ -2380); requires carbon dioxide, water, and a specific form of manganese oxide (can't remember off the top of my head what it is). Yields manganese and bicarbonate.

*Iron reduction (deltaG ~-790); requires carbon dioxide and ferric hydroxide. Yields ferric iron, bicarbonate, and water.

*Sulfate reduction (deltaG ~-450); requires sulfate. Yields hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonate. 

*Methanogenesis (deltaG ~-300); is directly inhibited by the presence of oxygen. Can either have the breakdown of organic matter OR the reaction between hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide which yields methane and water. 

All of these reactions require some sort of reductant; in the case of diagenesis in oceanic sediments, which is my frame of reference, the most notably reductant would be organic matter. In any event, there is preferential bias towards oxidants that have more energetically favorable reactions (which is why aerobic respiration is ubiquitous when O2 is available on both land and in the ocean). Sediment methanogenesis, at least in ocean sediments, is extremely important for 'recycling' carbon; otherwise, without methanogenesis, you would have a net accumulation of carbon in deeper sediments (below sulfidic layers where your only electron acceptor is your carbon source). 

A big question here is how 'closed' is the Martian system? What kind of redox reactions are favorable given conditions on Mars (i.e., iron-dominated reduction due to the absence of more favorable oxidants)? And, simply put, is it actually applicable to consider anaerobic respiration (not saying it's impossible, but rather there may be an abiotic methanogenic mechanism at play as opposed to biogenic)? 

Note: there have been numerous studies looking at abiotic methanogenesis and the potential does exist... I just don't know anything about Mars to really say anything regarding redox conditions. ",Torqameda,2014-12-17 19:34:39

Put another way: It may be that our tiny speck of dust in the universe is extremely unique... the far right hand tail of the bell curve... but (due to the nature of bell curves) that is extremely unlikely, and given the sheer scale of the universe, infinitessimally so.  Plus we can see around us for quite a distance, and spectrographic analysis shows us again and again that hydrogen and carbon fall into those rankings... even though we have surveyed only a tiny fraction of the totality of all that there is.

There are some wrinkles... there is way too much gravity to account for acceleration... so there is something out there that may rejigger our rankings, but we can't see it, and it doesn't seem to interact with any of the ways we observe things.

"Wait, what are you saying? The jump to unicellular life? Are you talking about abiogenesis happening more than once? Because /u/Pointsouturflaws was talking about the jump from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Finding prokaryotes on Mars wouldn't rule that out.

 And, just so you know, our sun is going to burn the planet to shreds in a billion years, which means the potential time frame for intelligent life to evolve was pretty short. We got lucky and were able to evolve in that time frame, but remember that the jump from prokaryotes to eukaryotes took 2.5-3 billion years. If conditions on the Earth had remained the same, we wouldn't have evolved before the sun burnt out the possibility of complex life at all.

Personally, I'm of the opinion that extraterrestrial prokaryotish (or pre-prokaryotish) life will be found at some point. But eukaryotish life will be very rare. 

Did you know that conditions on Venus and Mars were ripe for life in the early ages of our Solar System? I'm not sure when the boundary was, but obviously they're not still that suitable today. This could be another bottleneck (or Great Filter). 

Honestly, I think this whole ""Great Filter"" thing is deeply flawed. There are a lot of bottlenecks involved in getting to intelligent life.

"The opinion is that it would mean that we as a species have a low chance of becoming a Type II or Type III civilization. As in, we will die out soon.

However, we don't see signs of intelligent life having colonized the galaxy, even though there was ample time for it. Therefore, there must be something stopping it from happening. 

Here's the part I don't agree with: They suggest that if there was life on Mars, then life in the universe is plentiful. They then make the jump that intelligent life must be plentiful, and the ""Great Filter"" stopping it from happening is something between evolving intelligent life and getting to a Type III civilization.

"Methane is a small, simple molecule; the most simple one you can come up with using only C and H, and as a bonus it's the most reduced C.

"Titan has a nitrogen rich atmospheric but there isn't much oxygen. So you couldn't get combustion. It is possible though if I suppose there's an oxidizer in the ice on titan but I'm not positive on that.

But even with oxygen in the atmosphere, I don't think so. On a very cold day (even not that cold), if you drop a lit match into a puddle of gasoline, what happens? Nothing, the match gets wet and goes out. (I do not take any responsibility if anybody gets hurt recreating this - do it at your own risk)  Why? Because it's not gasoline itself that's flammable, it's the vapors. You need a warn day, or strong and/or steady enough heat to create gas vapors to ignite first.

Titan is colder than just cold. A simple cigarette would not do it. To give you an idea, methane is liquid at atmospheric pressure at -160 celsius. Titan is about 1.5 atm at the surface (it has less gravity than earth but a denser atmosphere) so the boiling point would be somewhat higher, but not by that much.",rtechnix,2014-12-17 20:54:16

Part of what heats the core is the gravitational pressure, the other part is nuclear decay.

Mars is about .1 Earth masses, so that could be one reason it died out sooner.

Edit:
&gt;For all this, however, Marone says, the vast majority of the heat in Earth's interiorâup to 90 percentâis fueled by the decaying of radioactive isotopes like Potassium 40, Uranium 238, 235, and Thorium 232 contained within the mantle.

"Cores are a spinning ball of molten metal. Moving electrons in the metal create the magnetic field. When the core cools down, it solidifies. This kills the magnetic field.

Different compositions of the cores will affect how long they stay hot. Nuclear decay also provides significant heat. Our iron core is still nice and hot, but it will eventually solidify. Our atmosphere will be stripped away and our surface blasted with sun rays.",fundayz,2014-12-17 19:13:08

It also is always moving, melting, and heating up due to matter moving around below the earth's surface. it's all the metals moving around in the mantle and outer core that keep Earth's magnetic field going.

As for eventually cooling down, from my searching it doesn't seem likely on any human timescale. Earth generates a lot of heat and does not lose very much of it over time.

"Space is another place where the water could have gone. The water in the earlier atmosphere could have broken down from solar energy and then the lighter isotopes could have been lost to space.

Also, impacts are very efficient at removing water from a planet. A sufficiently large impact can remove all atmospheric materials tangential to the impact.

"As far as I can tell, there are three different results here. Finding old water, finding momentary increases in methane, and finding some mix of organic molecules.

* Old water - Finding water on mars isn't new. But the water found within this rock is the opposite of new... it's old. This water is a snapshot of what the water used to look like a long time ago. This is a first step in building a picture of Mars's water history. So, as far as excitement, we'll put it at the first paintbrush stroke on a painting... but we don't yet know if it's the Mona Lisa or your kids' refrigerator art. But it's still better than no painting at all.

* Increase in methane. They'd been able to detect methane already, but what was detects was a short term burst of a ten-fold increase in the amount of methane they were measuring. This suggests pockets where methane is collected. Methane is often produced from biological processes, but it can also be produced through other non-biological processes as well. Still, it's weird for the amount of methane not to be constant. I personally don't know what could cause these pockets of methane, but it's worth looking for the source of the methane.

* Organic molecules. Some people in this thread are getting the methane result and the organic molecules result mixed up, but those are separate measurements. The problem is, what organic compounds? Well, we don't know, because there are also perchlorate minerals which apparently messes up the measurements that tell us *which* compounds they were.

So, overall it's not a Holy-Shit. But it's definitely more than meh. It's one of those ""now we have *more* questions than we had before"" kind of things. The answers to those questions might be life, or they might be something else. Or maybe a little bit of both.",N8CCRG,2014-12-17 15:54:05

Earth's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, with some oxygen and carbon-dioxide, and other stuff in small amounts. CO2 is poisonous in large amounts, and your car plan wouldn't provide oxygen or nitrogen (I think nitrogen can be replaced with some other inert gas, but I'm not sure) so you wouldn't be able to breath it, but you might be able to walk around outside with an air tank.",vorpal_username,2014-12-17 14:52:29

if you are asking this to know about aliens and flying saucers then you should know that these do not exist, if you mean it about past microbial life surging on solar system bodies, like it may have surged on Mars then the answer is around 30 years from now, maybe a bit more if we can't find anything around the surface of the planet because then it would mean that we would need to drill to try and find extremophiles that may be hiding in the depths of the planet where liquid water/humidity may exist to an extent.

Let me rephrase if it got confusing, the answer for the solar system should be around 30 years from now, by then we should have sent a couple probes/rovers to Titan and more importantly Europa, and we should know more or less if there is/was life on Mars by then. 

The 2100 answer is for Exoplanets, life as we know it changes the atmosphere of his host planet, and that change can be detected fairly easily with spectrographs, the issue we have now is that the spectrographs we have in existence are not sensitive enough to be used on planets, the bright of their host stars is just too much compared to the very small amount of reflected light coming from the small orbiting planets, James Webb *should* be powerful enough to detect the oxygen/water/wherever's on the planets atmospheres which will allow us to know the atmospheres of known candidate planets (Thank you Kepler!) and that way know if said planets host multicellular life like the one we have here on earth.

Omg i may get hanged for saying this by other scientists, but...... At least 75%. It may be my undergrad ignorance, but Europa is just too attractive for life, we know with a decent degree of certainty that life started on the geothermic trenches in the bottom of the oceans, without sunlight! And Europa with his tides should have said warm trenches where the rock touches the deep European ocean, we know it has organic molecules because of the ice geysers that like to throw a bunch of material to space. Hell that bloody moon has more water than us. Europa has basically everything it needs to support life now.

Pleaseeee note that we don't have ALL the data about Europa, first we NEED to get a rover and a dedicated satellite there, it is unknown whether the ice sheets are more or less ""solid"" or are they floating on a huge ocean, of course the later would be much more promising for life but the first isn't as bad, just see how well extremophiles are doing under the frozen Antarctic lakes.

Also we are searching for oxygen because we don't know what kinds of life could be out there, and since we don't know how these lifeforms work we don't know what to search for to find them, and because we have limited resources to find life we need to prioritize and search for what we already know, and that is carbon life that uses oxygen/photosynthesis.",Kantuva,2014-12-18 07:45:22

"Either we find life itself or its remains on Mars or another body in the Solar System, or detect activity and/or signals from an exoplanet that can only come from life.

Finding RNA/Bacteria or other life forms, even methane based, on Titan would do it.  Finding fossilized bacteria on Mars, or compounds that must have been produced by bacteria or other forms of life.  Ditto on anywhere else- RNA, bacteria, or evidence of compounds only produced by life.

Outside our Solar System, detecting signals via SETI, or getting signals/improving our detection capabilities to the point we could detect life on exoplanets would be the smoking gun, but that requires much, much better tech than we currently have, unless it's a clear signal.",TakoyakiBoxGuy,2014-12-17 15:43:05

"Well... as far as intelligent life goes, the drake equation states that the range may be anywhere from 80 to 34,000,000 civilizations in the universe.  but the drake equation is just a really far out guesstimate as to the number of planets that have life.

There are a couple places in our own solar system that may be capable of having life, such as europa and ganymede (moons of jupiter).  They have icy crusts that sit on what scientists believe are large salty oceans that stay at a liquid temperature due to heat from the core and tidal heating.

Additionally, we are always discovering more and more earth-like planets being discovered during the Kepler mission, with 14 earth-like exoplanets orbiting their host stars in the habitable zone being discovered from 2011-2014 ([link to list here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potentially_habitable_exoplanets)).

If we don't find life in our solar system, the timeline for discovering (or confirming) life on another planet would take until we can send probes to other solar systems and exoplanets, which could mean a very long time.

"Heavy water to 'normal' water ratios are at least somewhat variable, however, as far as I understand.

We've operated on several assumptions related to the D/H ratio for meteorites and comets for a while, but is it not possible that for whatever reason Mars' starting D/H ratio started at a significantly higher rate than that found on earth, and these suppositions about Mars losing it's water much earlier might be erroneous?

For example, the Rosetta mission most recently found the highest D/H ratio that I'm aware that we've found so far which skews a lot of our ideas.",hughnibley,2014-12-17 12:31:42
"That's what I'm thinking. It would explain the contradiction in these two paragraphs:

&gt;The D-to-H ratio in Cumberland is about half the ratio found in the Martian atmosphere's water vapor today, NASA officials said. This suggests that the planet lost much of its surface water after the Cumberland rock formed, space agency officials added in the same statement.

&gt;But the water sample is also about three times ""heavier"" than Earth's oceans. This means that if Mars' surface water started off with a D-to-H ratio like Earth's, then most of the Martian water likely disappeared before Cumberland formed about 3.9 billion to 4.6 billion years ago.

I really can't believe that the water disappeared 4 billion years ago ... there are clear signs of liquid water carving solid rock over millions of years, and 4 billion years ago the planet was likely only just getting over cooling off from formation, meaning it probably had a decent magnetic field from a molten mantle to protect its atmosphere, therefore water (vapor).",astrawnomore,2014-12-17 14:56:43

"The solar wind is a stream of ions, basically protons, moving away radially from the Sun. Since the motion of charged particles is affected by magnetic fields, the magnetic field of a planet acts to deflect the solar wind away. Without this, the solar wind literally erodes the atmosphere away over several million years.

Planetary magnetic fields (at least for terrestrial, or Earthlike planets) are thought to be caused by a molten iron mantle rotating around a solid iron core. The strength of the field depends on the radius and speed of the mantle rotation, so as a planet cools down, its mantle slows down and eventually solidifies. The magnetic field then dissipates and exposes the atmosphere, and in short order the atmosphere goes away.",astrawnomore,2014-12-17 17:25:18

For example, the ephemeral methane detection could be methane from Earth in the rover degassing somehow. With only a quick detection, that could not be ruled out yet even if it is unlikely.

"I'm going to try and summarise the main findings- Im not an expert but im studying Geochemistry at uni so Ill give it a shot.

Here are the three main interesting Martian geochemistry papers released this year:

[1. Mineralogy of Gale crater mudstone](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1243480.abstract)

[2. More geochemistry of the mudstones](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6169/1245267)

[3. Looking at water found in clay minerals - the one released recently that this article is based on](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/12/15/science.1260291.abstract)

Sooo the water found is not a liquid it is bound up in minerals - which make up the martian rocks. This isn't like a sponge holding water, the water molecule actually forms part of the mineral. Here's [Gypsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsum) one of the suspected minerals. You can see H2O makes up part of the chemical formula. These minerals in most cases require liquid water to form so the fact they exist suggests that liquid water was present at some point.

Now onto the organics. The finding of organics, particularly methane, is potentially exciting but we should hold back for a second. Methane can be produced by abiotic (meaning not-living) processes and the word 'organic' just means that it contains carbon chains. 

Organic molecules can be found within 'space-dust' and meteorites (known geologically as chondrites). Lab studies have shown that ultraviolet light can cause the release methane from this space dust and the meteorites([4.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7401/full/nature11203.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120607)). It can also form from meteor impacts, but there havent been any recent local impact events (3.).
Methane can be found as ice within [methane clathrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate) which are found on many different planets ([4.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22908239);[5.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103587900753)). The methane ice can't be ruled out as a source (1.). The thing that's causing excitement is that the methane occurred as a kind of 'bubble' or 'plume' in that it was detected within a short time period and the models of the abiotic 'methanogenic' processes do not totally explain the plume (3.).",liamkun,2014-12-17 15:57:35

Is this correct thinking?",RedMushtoom,2014-12-17 20:35:55
"No. Mars was warm, wet, and hospitable for life when Earth was still a molten ball of Lava. Just like astronomers KNEW there had to be planets orbiting other stars, the issue was being able to PROVE IT. 

Same thing goes with Mars. There's a lot of tantalizing evidence to show that Mars was, and may even be hospitable for life. Maybe just bacteria, but finding even single-celled organisms on another planet would have amazing implications. ",dearastronomer,2014-12-17 22:09:28
"Mars may have been wet and warm at the time, but that's not all you need for life. The planet needs to have some form of magnetosphere to protect the surface from solar radiation. Mars has a very weak magnetosphere. I believe the Sun was a lot more active during its early history, and threw off a lot more solar radiation than it does today. You also need time. While it's true that life arose on Earth almost as soon as it was possible to do so I don't think there would have been enough time for this to occur on Mars. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Timeline_of_Solar_System_evolution) around 4.6bya the Sun was still developing, and the terrestrial planets had just been formed. The article's time frame of 4.6 to 3.9bya means that Mars would have lost its water almost immediately. There's also the concern of meteor bombardments. Around this time the terrestrial planets were getting smacked by giant rocks on a regular basis. Very hostile conditions for any kind of life.

Granted, finding any kind of life on Mars would be awesome, but the timing of things concerning when Mars had water is discouraging. ",RedMushtoom,2014-12-18 08:01:22
"Mars has a weak magnetosphere NOW. Evidence is present in the rock layers for a much stronger magnetosphere in the past. 

As for mars losing water almost immediately, there's still some strong debate on that. Best estimates I've seen is that around 3.5Gya Mars started  drying out rapidly, with periods of ""wetness"" every so often, with each cycle being less and less wet. 

If life ever did develop on Mars, there's a good chance it may still be present in subsurface aquifers. Given the wide range of extremophiles on Earth, we've got pretty good evidence for how resilient life can be once started. ",dearastronomer,2014-12-18 09:05:49

Until someone arrives who does, I can say that generally we find any extraterrestrial organic compounds significant because *from our experience*, organic complexity (carbon molecules doing increasingly complicated stuff) was one of several early steps toward life.

We don't know if all types of life require organic complexity, or if *most* types of life tend to come from carbon based structures or... well we only have one data point, so we don't even know what we know and what we don't know.

So finding organic compounds on another planet (especially a currently barren one) is useful.  It's not exactly fitting another piece into the puzzle though... it's probably more akin to taking a piece out of the box and putting in on the mat.

The ones that are travelling very fast will occasionally have so much speed that they can just shoot right out of the atmosphere -- Mars' gravity cannot hold it there. This process will keep going, the fastest molecules being ejected each time.

The important point here is that strictly speaking in this scenario, Mars never had the gravity to hold it all in to begin with, and that is not what changed.

"Well, this isn't all that crazy really.  From what I know about Abiogenesis, it's thought to happen in severe, even hellish environments.  The stuff that made life possible (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorous etc) is really common.  It's not like Plutonium or some other such element is responsible for the formation of organic molecules.


If life started somewhere (here) and it relied on a set of volatile circumstances and what amounts to the top row of the periodic table, it's pretty likely that life could form elsewhere, possibly every where.  It just so happens that Earth had a set of circumstances that followed the formation of basic organic molecules (we're really talking amino acids here) that was conducive to the formation of cells.  Then as the environment changed over time, those changes were in one way or another beneficial or at the very least non-detrimental to the continuation of life.  


If that happened elsewhere or not is yet to be determined but I would hazard a guess it's not as uncommon as we keep trying to tell ourselves.  Feeling special, getting in the way of science.  SSDD.  


Of course I have no proof of this, but I suspect there is life on Jupiter for instance.  It actually produces more heat than it receives and has tons of molecular junk to toy with that's also being vigorously mixed due to weather forces.  I've never heard a solid hypothesis in this vein but considering how life is capable of existing at the very bottom of the ocean, situated around thermal vents of ridiculous temperature, the thought of crazy atmospheric aliens on Jupiter doesn't seem so crazy.

The Gas giants, Jupiter/Saturn/Neptune/Venus act as filters for the solar system keeping things clean for the current habital planet earth, meanwhile Mercury is in the oven being formed and Venus is in the incubation stage.

The rings that Saturn has could actually be like a dust remover except it's an asteroid remover, it  attracts the asteroid within the solar system in an attempt to keep the main planet ""earth"" safe from harmful  debris from entering it's atmosphere.

The other Gas giants could act as a delivery system for resources that enter the atmosphere of earth, we know that the sun's rays are what allow plants to grow along with water and that it pretty much is a driving force that allows life to be possible, but what's to say that resources found on the gas giants aren't sent to earth in one way or another.

"In a word it means nothing. I think NASA hypes this up to get more funding. People act like if you get some water and some organic compounds then, bam, must've been life was inevitable. It's really not that easy. Even with a bunch of organic compounds floating around in water, even with lightening...the chances that the steps needed to jump to life are probably many orders of magnitude less probable than people are imagining. Scientists are creative crowd and they still don't have a great theory of how all the steps would have to have worked. What does seem clear as it would've had to involve some very very unlikely coincidences. Some molecules coming together in particular ways by chance the first time in order to be self replicating, to evolve in a way that allowed the addition of complexity (Spiegelman's monster inevitably LOST complexity as it spread/evolved), and then to gain ""control"" over a lipid membrane in such a way that the membrane would split always and only when the ""genetic"" molecule replicated. Oh, and then the self replicating molecule ALSO has to by chance start coding for proteins, and those proteins have to get usefully embedded in the membranes. Some of those steps might be accountable for by natural selection (though those mutations would still have to happen randomly the first time), but others of the steps would have to have happened by sheer chance and would have to have come together all at once to be worth anything at all (I hate to sound like the ""design"" crowd, but there is something ""irreducibly complex"" about, for example, the ribosome and RNA...there wouldnt have been replication, and thus selection, before replication occurs. That had to happen by sheer chance). 

What is that chance? We don't know because we only have one data point. Life arose once on earth, and it took a billion years. Some people think that's a relatively short time, but that doesn't tell us much about the chance with only one data point. All we know is that there's a 50% chance it occured within the middle 50% of possible timeframe probabilities, a 5% chance it occured within the first 5% of timeframe probsbilities, etc",Froginalog,2014-12-17 19:12:04
"&gt; I hate to sound like the ""design"" crowd, but there is something ""irreducibly complex"" about, for example, the ribosome and RNA...there wouldnt have been replication, and thus selection, before replication occurs. That had to happen by sheer chance

RNA didn't necessarily have to be the first replicator. It is even possible that the first replicator was an inorganic material like a clay.",dark_magnetar,2014-12-17 23:26:18
"No, right, that was just an example.

But you need SOME replicator that can mutate and gain complexity without losing the ability to replicate.

The simpler the replicator, the more likely a mutation will destroy the whole ability to replicate.

Certainly, we've never found a great ""easy"" (ie, high probability) candidate yet. Otherwise we'd have started, in labs, our own new early-stage abiogenesis.

Yet if the solution was something very ""simple,"" you'd think we'd have found it by now and watched it replicate and gain new mutations.

But even something like Spiegelman's Monster LOST complexity through selection rather than gained.

I suspect the first pre-life was a chance occurrence of perhaps dozens or even hundreds of atoms or more basic molecules coming together in just the right way to allow everything else needed for evolvable/selectable replication with the possibility of complexity/information gain.

And even then, other steps (like commandeering a lipid membrane) may have had to be pure chance (well, all mutations are pure chance, but I mean that step may have required a sort of MUTUAL symbiosis or ""fitting together"" co-occuring by chance rather than just a mutation on one end or the other, ie two seperate mutations coincident).

I doubt it's something inevitable, as even on earth it took a billion years to occur by chance.

We really simply don't know the magnitude of the probability yet. A second data point (if there is one) would help, but even without one maybe it would be possible to estimate a probability based on a model analogous to ""if a billion moneys typed 100 words per minute for a billion years, what's the chance a specific string of such and such a length would occur"" type of idea. But that would require knowing how many basic parts (atoms or more common smaller molecules) the first irreducible evolve-able replicator had, how common those components were, how ""spread out"" they were in the primordial ocean, what sort of other conditions (temperature, energy, ph etc) were needed for them to react together when in each other's presence and aligned just right, etc",Froginalog,2014-12-18 11:28:07
"&gt; Certainly, we've never found a great ""easy"" (ie, high probability) candidate yet. Otherwise we'd have started, in labs, our own new early-stage abiogenesis.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet if the solution was something very ""simple,"" you'd think we'd have found it by now and watched it replicate and gain new mutations.

It is important not to unintentionally conflate simple with something we can easily replicate in a lab. For example, in the clay replicator scenario, the clay can be something that is chemically very simple. The catch is that it only works on large length scales and long time scales, because that is what is necessary for clays to meaningfully influence their environment. Or, in the case of experiments like Miller-Urey, maybe they had the right idea, and they just needed a larger vat or a longer time to do the experiment. I don't think we have enough experimental data yet to conclude that we *haven't* yet found the ""easy"" candidate -- it is just that easy needs to be interpreted on dimensions that are unfamiliar to the typical laboratory experiment.

&gt; But even something like Spiegelman's Monster LOST complexity through selection rather than gained.

It is not clear how much one should read into this, since it is just one experiment testing one particular replicator.

&gt; I suspect the first pre-life was a chance occurrence of perhaps dozens or even hundreds of atoms or more basic molecules coming together in just the right way to allow everything else needed for evolvable/selectable replication with the possibility of complexity/information gain.

I believe calculations have been done which suggest that this scenario is unlikely even on billion-year timescales, but I don't recall where I read that. Part of the problem is that just forming a molecule like this by chance isn't enough, since it has to be able to live long enough to come into contact with the other necessary components.",dark_magnetar,2014-12-18 17:14:41

After letting the soil particulates settle for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted in molten SMS media (0.125 g casein, 0.1 g potato starch, 1 g casamino acids, 20 g bacto-agar in 1 litre of water) to achieve an average concentration of one cell per 20 Âµl of medium. Then 20 Âµl aliquots were then dispensed into the wells of an iChip. The iChip was placed in direct contact with the soil. After one month of incubation, the iChips were disassembled and individual colonies were streaked onto SMS agar to test for the ability to propagate outside the iChip and for colony purification.

They basically attempt to isolate single cells and let them form a small colony in their native soil, and then transfer those colonies to agar plates to try to establish more robust colonies. They still ultimately grow them on agar.",Monory,2015-01-07 12:15:09
"You are missing what is truly novel about their technique (I think, my appologies if not). The iChip was placed in direct contact with soil and any nutrients or growth factors in the soil could permeate through a filter and ""feed"" the bacteria within the agar. 

The problem with using agar plates / petri dishes has nothing to do with the agar itself or the way it grows, but the carbon sources (food) and the growth factors (sort of like vitamins) that are added to the growth media not being able to support bacterial growth.

Sure they are still using agar as a medium for colonies to grow on, but they are putting these iChips back into their native environment so that the bacteria can grow using whatever nutrients are available there. The iChip serves as a barrier so that a single cell can grow within the well and form a homogeneous colony, and not be contaminated by any other bacteria.

Edit: The other cool, but maybe not novel, thing about the iChip is how they grow colonies from single cells so that you have homogeneous populations to study. The iChip has many very tiny wells within it that are isolated from each other. When they innoculate the chip, they dilute their sample containing bacteria out enough to that by chance each well will receive only one single bacteria. Some wells will have 2 and some will have none by random chance, but the majority will have one single cell. That single cell will then hopefully grow into a larger colony of the same bacteria. It's very difficult to do experiments on a single cell of bacteria, but when you have many cells in a colony you can really start working with it. Like discovering a novel compound that the bacteria produces.

"Yep! We found non-toxigenic cholera in a Northeastern estuary in the water column, sediment and oysters throughout the summer. In the winter, we could only detect cholera by PCR in sediment samples but could never culture it because of VBNC. We couldn't find any viable samples in the winter at all anywhere in the estuary. Then once the water warms up in the late spring, we could start culturing it again. So I guess cholera hibernates in a sense.",smashy_smashy,2015-01-08 08:50:00

&gt;Teixobactin was isolated from a previously unknown Gram-negative bacterium that lives in soil and cannot be cultured in the lab using standard techniques. So the researchers applied an approach called Ichip, developed jointly by Lewis and Slava Epsteinâs lab, in which a soil sample is diluted with agar, and a single bacterial cell is suspended in a chamber surrounded with semi-permeable membrane. The researchers pack 96 such chambers into a single device, which they then place in soilâallowing the bacteria access to nutrients and growth factors but not to escape. This cultivation approach is an innovative way to tap into the rich biodiversity that we are currently missing because only 1 percent of microorganisms can be cultured in the lab, said Wright.  âThis biodiversity is also hiding a lot of chemical diversity that may include other new antibiotics.â 

&gt;âThis is a very clever technique,â added Robert Austin, a physicist at Princeton University who studies the evolution of microbes and was not involved in the current study. âThe bacteriology community needs to get away from culturing bacteria on agar plates, because this will not lead to new antibiotics.â",Simonovski,2015-01-07 12:07:36

Some bacteria may require small amounts of certain trace metals that wouldn't normally be found in tap water everywhere or in the media components. We also don't necessarily know it's preferred temperature for growth or how aerotolerant the organism is. Usually these scientist who go out trying to find bacteria will attempt o grow things in various sets of media that have are know to grow organisms found in whatever ecological niche they collected the sample from - and it's pretty likely a lot of work went into coming up with those mediums, messing around with compositions trying to isolate new bacteria can be tricky and often fruitless.

Time for someone smart to tell us why this isn't as big of news as it sounds...,jeronimoe,2015-01-07 11:54:17
"Here's the paper: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html

The important thing about this is the way the new antibiotic, Teixobactin, was found... One new antibiotic is nice but only goes so far.... a system that can repeatedly produce new antibiotics in a turn-key fashion is MUCH more useful.

The OP's article doesn't really explain well how this was found and why it falls into that turn-key repeatable class of operations, but I can fill that in.  The key thing to note is the fact that one of the authors of the Teixobactin paper is Slava Epstein.  Slava Epstein is someday going to get a Nobel prize.  This is because of the fact that he has solved the culture problem... the fact that most organisms won't grow in a petri dish.  

The way he did this is pretty cool:  He realized that it wasn't that they COULDN'T grow in the lab, it's that they WOULDN'T grow.  Bacteria, like most organisms, take cues from their environment: for example a bear doesn't intrinsically know when winter is coming, rather he sees the leaves change, and the birds flying south and from this data (that predominantly originates from other organisms) knows when it's time to get ready to hibernate.  Likewise, bacteria collect information from their environment in the form of soluble molecules, mostly produced by other micro-organisms, to know when it's a good bet for crucial biological processes such as cell-division... if they don't get those signals, then they don't divide.  Since the other organisms providing those signals do not exist in the otherwise sterile petri-dishes in a laboratory... they won't divide there.  

So, what Slava Epstein's lab did was that they collected bacterial cells from the soil, suspended them in a lump of agarose (basically gelatin) called a ""plug"", and then surrounded that agarose plug with a semi-permeable membrane which would not let cells through, but would let small molecules through, and then put the whole thing back into the soil that the bacteria were first removed from.  Because the small molecules of the environment can enter this agarose plug, the cells suspended there know to divide.  When the agarose plug is later retrieved there are colonies of bacteria growing there.... but this is just the beginning.  Each of these colonies is composed of many cells that are all descended from a single bacteria that would grow in the soil environment but not the lab.  Slava Epstein's people then collected cells from such a colony, those cells were then placed into two new agarose plugs.  One of those new plugs was placed back into the soil, and one into an incubator in the lab.  Of course the cells in the soil plug grow since they are getting whatever signalling molecules they need from whatever else is in the soil.  But there's a chance that the incubator cells will grow too... the reason is that the more you grow the cells, the more you select for UNCONDITIONAL growth.  That is, as the cells divide, mutations will naturally occur and eventually a mutation will occur that causes the cell to stop looking for whatever signal(s) it normally needs in the environment in order to unlock growth.  Some times this is a easy mutation to arise, and sometimes it takes many dozens of rounds of harvesting colonies from soil-agarose-plugs... but it's just a matter of time eventually evolution will work and the selective pressures created by this system will force an unconditional growth phenotype.  The final result is a previously ungrowable bacteria that is now domesticated and growable in the lab.  Once you have that, you can test it for the production of useful products such as antibiotics.  Want to test more products?  No big deal, just repeat he above system with more organisms... since there's a near unlimited and unique diversity of micro organisms in every single cubic foot of dirt, you'll basically never run out.

Of course, in the long run, synthetic biology techniques that allow us to bypass messing with growing the source organisms for such products and just skip ahead to the products themselves by sequencing DNA from single cells and then synthesizing the interesting parts of that DNA that encode for products (called ""biosynthetic clusters"") and then expressing them in already convenient laboratory or industrial microorganisms.   But the bacteria domestication approach is still important for several reasons:  It proves the underlying thesis that the reason we had ""run out"" of antibiotics wasn't that there aren't more, but merely because we were only looking in same very small space over and over again.  Also, many of these interesting gene products, like antibiotics, must be synthesized from metabolic intermediates that are not universally in all bacteria.  That makes the domestication approach faster to produce products of interest in the short term.  However, in the next 10-15 years look to see the synthetic biology world creating chassis organisms with interchangeable metabolisms to address this.

Great explanation. I have one question; why doesn't the unconditional growth mutation occur naturally and override the conditional growth genes? Why is conditional growth a naturally selected trait over unconditional growth?,Slight0,2015-01-07 15:29:29
"EXCELLENT QUESTION!

The answer is embedded into two facts:

* Bacteria live hand-to-mouth:  Things happen fast on the molecular and cellular levels, and bacteria are constantly balanced on a knife's edge of reaction to any of thousands of environmental stresses that can have life-or-death consequences for them if they don't react (such as by turning on genes in the nick of time) or react poorly (such as turning on the wrong genes).  (Most bacterial genes are turned off until the instant they are needed).  Similarly, almost all of them literally can't store enough energy and material to replicate inside their own volumes all at one time... they have to start replication before they have enough to finish it.  This bring us to:

* Cell division is a risk for a bacteria:  Resources have to be diverted into copying DNA (a non-trivial metabolic cost in its own right) those resources would otherwise have been maintaining the machinery of the cell: replacing ribosomes, lipids, and proteins as they naturally degrade etc.  If mid-division, a cell's resources get critically low, the cell division will stall.  If this stall state persists too long, the cell may not be able to recover.  Even if it succeeds in dividing, both daughter cells end up splitting the remaining resources of the mother cell between them. If that resource pool is too small, one or both may die.  Further, while a bacteria is dividing, it's ability to cope with environmental dangers is often compromised.  For example the activity of it's own replication machinery might make it more apt to be taken over by a virus (which in some cases co-opt some of that machinery), or the activity of the DNA polymerase crossing a gene might hamper the competing activity of the RNA polymerase to cross that same gene and thus interrupt the just-in-time production of the gene's product.

The result is that cells which grow unconditionally on average are taking unnecessary risks.  If the cell can wait for a signal that indicates conditions are now, and will likely continue to be favorable, for reproduction then that risk is at least partially mitigated.  This is why the vast majority of bacteria don't grow unconditionally.  It should be pointed out, however, that this limits the niche that the bacteria can persist in to one where that signal exists and is a better than random indication of when it is safe to replicate... since that limitation also has its downsides, there are also some bacteria that do grow unconditionally.",Lucretius,2015-01-07 16:19:11

"To my knowledge he has only begun to look into this.  He has shown that certain, not yet domesticated bacteria, can grow in a dish if side-by-side with other bacteria.  This forms his working hypothesis that all/most of these signals originate from life (and will thus be molecules that are potentially very diverse while also being potentially difficult to synthesize with conventional organic chemistry), mostly he presumes that they are made by other microbes.

"As I understood it: The bacteria don't evolve unconditional growth in the lab, it has a chance of doing so when growing in the weird soil device. Epstein checks the soil growth for unconditional growth by giving it a chance in the lab. If it doesn't have unconditional growth, it won't survive in the lab, so Epstein just puts some more back in the soil and tries again in however long it takes bacteria to grow. 

You roll the evolutionary dice every time you grow in the soil medium, then if the numbers are right, it will grow in the lab. Roll the dice enough times, hopefully get the result you need. ",ninjasimon,2015-01-08 06:15:56
"Ohh, I see.

Aren't the chances really low though?

I mean the bacteria have been growing in the soil for ages, yet the species still haven't evolved unconditional growth.

Why are they expecting it to happen now?",someguyfromtheuk,2015-01-08 06:49:54
"If I'm understanding right, they have developed unconditional growth many, many times - but in a non-ideal environment like the soil, growing unconditionally is a risk, and those bacteria didn't do as well as their more selective cousins and died off. Take them out of the soil and stick them in a lab where there's unlimited resources but no signaling from other organisms, and if the unconditional growth version is present it will take over.",LogicalTimber,2015-01-08 07:41:33
"There may have already been mutations that coded for unconditional growth, but being in the environment that they were, those mutations would not have been beneficial to the bacteria. As Lucretius mentioned above, bacteria are vulnerable during their reproductive stage. The conditional growth ""trait"" helps this by looking for environmental signals that indicate that there are an appropriate amount of resources, the right conditions, etc. that are ideal for reproduction. That way, the bacteria will only produce in an environment where reproduction can be carried through until the end. 

In regards to the extremely low chances of mutating unconditional growth, you are exactly correct. However, it's important to remember that bacteria can reproduce at a much faster rate than say, humans. With bacteria, we are able to roll the dice much faster than with other organisms. Because of this, the likelihood of mutating  unconditional growth, while still small, is doable. ",Kurtish,2015-01-08 09:08:11

"This may be a long stretch, but is this method also viable to fix the problems that caused the Biosphere experiment to fail?",Smartassperson,2015-01-07 14:33:42
"The problem that caused the biosphere experiment to fail was ultimately that it was too big and complex:  Carbon rich soil + soil-bacterial oxidative respiration caused oxygen from the internal atmosphere to be tied up into CO2 which in turn got segregated into CaCO3 inside the concrete foundation and walls.  Once pollinators dies off other species became endangered.... Multiple independent climate zones, thousands of species... It was orders of magnitude too complex.  I'm amazed it worked as well as it did.

It all comes down to the fact that they designed their experiment from an ideologically driven top-down holistic approach rather than a bottom-up engineering approach.  (That is they were motivated by wanting to make certain environmentalist points about the importance of species diversity, multiple ecosystems working together, etc... this ultimately political desire caused good experimental design to take a back stage).  

If you wanted to do the Biosphere project right, then you would start with as simple a system as you could get to work, and then move upward in complexity:  For example: Just 3 species: Human, an Anaerobic bacteria, and an algae.Start by managing their growth and metabolisms artificially, and only allow for natural homeostasis to take over as you understand the dynamics of the system.  It's less dramatic, less flashy, less political... but better design.

But to answer your question, yes eventually you might want to use the Slava Epstein method to create carefully defined microbiological communities, including for applications in paraterraforming such as Biosphere2.

"&gt; I'd say keep it IV and limit use only as a last line measure. Which I think will happen as we have seen how quickly antibiotic resistance can develop and how helpless we are when in occurs. 

What I'm hoping will happen is that this antibiotic and others that will hopefully be developed from the same bacterial domestication approach will eventually replace our moder suite of antibiotics entirely.  Our modern suite could then be retired and not used at all for 70-100 years.  In that time, without the current suite of antibiotics being used, there would be no selective pressure for bacteria to remain resistance to them.  Then, after the 70-100 year fallow period, we'll be able to recycle the current suite and let the replacements lay fallow for 70-100 years.  In this way, we'd rotate antibiotics into and out of use so as to keep them useful indefinately if not continuously.

Actually it does.  With enough antibiotics the key to defeating resistance is to simply cycle them.  Resistance almost always has a cost to the bacteria that means it is only beneficial when we are using the antibiotic.

"Ok, the finding of the new antibiotic is great and exciting news indeed. No one is doubting that. The issue comes with the technology used to find the bacteria which made this compound. I've seen many other posts in this thread commenting on how it deserves a nobel prize and is the most important discovery in our lifetimes and this is simply not true.


The technology for this company basically tries to solve the [great plate count anomaly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_ecology) which, in a nut shell, says we can only grow 1% of the entire microbial environment in a lab setting. Soil environments (and more importantly micro-environments) are incredibly complex. Standard microbiology plating techniques to isolate bacteria include streaking bacteria onto agar with some sort of carbon, nitrogen, amino acid, etc mixture which only allows around 1% of environmental bacteria to grow while the 99% of the remaining environmental microbes simply do not have the necessary growth factors (nutrients, correct pH, signals from other bacteria etc) to grow on a petri dish.

The iCHIP claims to solve the great plate anomaly allowing the remaining 99% of environmental microbes to thrive in a lab. A TLDR explanation is they dilute bacteria from a soil sample down to single cells in agar and place it between two membranes which is then inserted back into the soil it originated from. The membranes have pores which are small enough to allow factors from the soil to diffuse in and out while the single cell stays put. In theory this allows the 99% of unculturable bacteria to be exposed to their natural environment as well as the lab agar in hopes that the bacteria will learn to thrive on the agar with the help of the environmental nutrients diffusing in and out of the iCHIP. 


If this technology worked the majority of the isolates pulled from the iCHIP would be novel and a very small percent would be known species (greater than 96% homology to known sequences based on 16S). The truth is it's quite the opposite. On average out of 1000 bacterial isolates from the iCHIP maybe around 10-20 looked interesting (less than 96% homology to known 16s sequences). As a control we also plated the same soil onto agar plates and picked similar amounts of colonies and saw similar data sets. On average out of 1000 colonies picked from traditional microbiology streaking techniques we saw about 10-20 interesting colonies (less than 96% 16s homology) which is the same as the iCHIP. Assuming this technology works you would expect two completely different data sets from the iCHIP and the normal plating procedures. The iCHIP would have a significant higher amount of bacteria with 16s homology less than 95%. 

To break it down even more if you ran a standard isolation experiment you'd expect out of 1,000 environmental bacterial cells only 10 to be able to grow in a lab setting (based on the great plate count anomaly of 1%). If you ran 16s across those 10 isolates that grew you'd more than likely find a very high percentage match in Genbank. If the iCHIP did indeed work  out of those same 1,000 environmental bacterial cells you'd expect greater than 1% to grow. For sake of argument let's just say 2%. So you'd have 20 isolates grown instead of 10 and out of those 20 isolates you'd expect at least 50% to be completely novel and unknown. If this happened they'd on a consistent basis they'd be publishing on a weekly basis and creating entirely new taxonomy branches on a weekly basis. The technology has been in place for close to 14 years with very few modifications. They've essentially been mining for bacteria and finally got lucky. 





The numbers generated in this example above increase the cultivable bacteria from 1% to 2%, imagine the results if it were even higher? [The company claims 50%!!!](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature14098.html#ref10) (""Diffusion of nutrients and growth factors through the chambers enables growth of uncultured bacteria in their natural environment. The growth recovery by this method approaches 50%, as compared to 1% of cells from soil that will grow on a nutrient Petri dish""). If 50% were true and we used our example above then 500 out of the 1,000 total environmental bacteria would be grown up in a lab in which only 10 would be known sequences and 490 would be completely novel. You'd literally be swimming in novel bacteria and it would be actually harder to find a known species than an unknown species. However they also show [this table](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849220/table/t1/) which lists the similarity % of the 16s across normal petri dishes vs. their iCHIP technology. The OTU's across each percentage similarity are not that far off especially considering the number of isolates tested from the iCHIP were double the petri dish. 




The theory behind the technology does sound impressive and logical but in practice it does not own up to it's claims. In fact, in one of their own papers in which they discovered a different novel compound isolated from a bacteria using this technology they even admit the bacteria is 98% related to a known species which really isn't all that significant in the bacterial world and routinely happens when you streak soil on an agar surface without the iCHIP. This ""novel"" bacteria could have just as easily been isolated using standard microbiology techniques. Hell [groups are even isolating novel bacteria from belly buttons](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/1-458-bacteria-species-new-to-science-found-in-our-belly-buttons/266360/).

I'm happy to see progress in this field and companies still working on this major problem. However the hype around this is nauseating as it's appearing across Nature, the New York Times, etc. The fact they even made it gimmicky by adding ""i"" at the beginning to copy Apple makes it even worse.  I wish the technology worked as well as it claims but unfortunately it doesn't. It's quite possible to find compounds to kill the nasty stuff (MRSA, TB, etc.) but they rarely make it to market. This compound has a LOONNGGG way to go but i have my fingers crossed that there is some clinical implication in the future whether it be this compound of a chemical derivative.  


TLDR: The results from the iCHIP technology are not much greater than traditional plating technology. They just tend to conveniently leave this out of the hype as they're a Biotech looking for funding.

But the bigger thing is that this method provides an entirely new (and huge) area to look for antibiotics. So by the time we see resistance emerge for one drug, this method means we will likely already have other drugs to replace it. 

Antibiotic resistance itself will never go away. It's an arms race. But the more unique classes of antibiotics we have, the better equipped we are to fight. We still need to work as a society to drive down the rampant use of abx, but one of the looming dangers right now is that we will run out of effective drugs to treat infections.

"Hey, no problem. I'll answer as best I can, but a few caveats: I only have my bachelor's in biology, and this is a pretty complex question; also, theory is much different than reality.

That said, no. An individual cell might reverse the mutation. If, for instance, antibiotic resistance is conferred by a mutation that *adds* a function, such as a new metabolic pathway, then it's likely the cell could mutate back to normal because any random mutation could interrupt that new function, rendering it inert.

If, however, resistance is conferred by a mutation that *deletes* a function, such as a broken membrane transport protein or something, it's unlikely to revert back to normal, because the reverse mutation would have to occur at exactly the same place as the initial mutation, which is statistically improbable. 

More importantly, the mutation back to normal would have to have some kind of selective advantage in order to pass into the majority of a population. There's simply no advantage (usually) that comes with losing abx resistance, so even though a single cell could revert to normal, that mutation wouldn't spread.

If we could engineer that to happen, great. We could take a cell that had reverted to normal, engineer some kind of selective advantage into the cell (such as an increased rate of nutrient uptake) and allow that cell to become the primary strain. However, it would eventually gain resistance again, and we'd start the whole process over again.

Sorry, there's really not an easy solution. Biochemistry is incredibly complex and we really don't know enough to say for sure what can or can't happen. These are just my thoughts. ",michael22joseph,2015-03-14 22:56:30

http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/02/us-medical-research-spending-drops-while-asia-makes-gains

&gt; a study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found the United States comprised 51 percent of global research spending, at $131 billion in 2007. But by 2012, that number dropped to $119 billion, or 45 percent of the world's biomedical research spending.

&gt;...Public research spending in the United States climbed to $51.4 billion in 2010, and accounted for about 41 percent of the country's total research spending

So, a huge amount of public money is being spent on R&amp;D in the US.",Campesinoslive,2015-01-07 23:46:34

While research is funded, this does not resolve the issues of the industry that applies the results.  

Put another way, the fruits of research are often utilized by the industry with the motivation of ""How can we monetize this?"" instead of ""How can we best use this to serve humanity?""

"Well the other problem is that most of the ""easy"" antibiotics have already been found (based on structure &amp; function, since the early antibiotics were mostly natural or semi-synthetic).

"My understanding is that the antibiotics we currently have could have lasted much, much longer if one was introduced when resistance to a current one began.  

Instead, many were produced and released as soon as available.  For profit.  

How can we avoid this mistake again?  If a company invests in and finds a new antibiotic they're going to want to monetize it ASAP -- they won't want to wait.  

I'm glad this method has been discovered and, unlike so many ""breakthrough"" announcements, I look forward to real fruit from it.  But I lack faith that we won't somehow squander the opportunity, even with the lessons of the past.
",SoulSherpa,2015-01-08 06:36:35
"I definitely agree, unfortunately most pharmaceutical companies are driven by profits. Even if they aren't, the amount it costs to produce a new drug is astronomical (I need to pull out an older textbook for a specific number, but I think only 1 in 100 new drugs will make it from the initial pharmacokinetic/dynamic studies to consumer pill bottles), so companies have to make back all the money that they spend on R&amp;D. If companies like Pfizer &amp; Merck didn't make their R&amp;D money back through new drugs, they would have to shut their doors in a few years. 

Resistance doesn't really work by forming to one drug at a time, either. Whenever bacteria began developing beta-lactamase (enzyme that cleaves the active part of drugs like penicillin), it rendered not just one drug ineffective, but most beta-lactam antibiotics (this includes penicillin, cephalexin, &amp; some similar drugs). So, overnight these bacteria started popping up that were resistant to most of our first line antibiotics. Companies began developing more complex beta-lactams, or drugs like Augmentin (amoxicillin with clavulanic acid). Clavulanic acid breaks down that beta-lactamase enzyme, allowing amoxicillin to work whenever it was previously inactivated by the bacteria. 

Resistance can just pop up too, since it occurs by mutation. Drug-resistant strains of bacteria are commonly seen in countries where antibiotics are overprescribed, or where patient compliance is poor (a lot of new strains [come out of India](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/4/485.full)) because we're pretty much being social Darwinism at work. A patient takes an antibiotic for 5 out of 7 days, the bacteria left are the ones that have the enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring in the antibiotic; these bacteria repopulate &amp; the infection comes back x100. 

Resistance is terrifying, however I think the healthcare field has learned more about it over the past 15 years or so &amp; are doing a better job of preventing it from occurring in patients. ",swissarmybromance,2015-01-08 08:27:43

"The wikipedia article states that it would cost ""in the low hundred millions"" to develop this into a drug. This sounds like a fairly reasonable number to me, on an order of magnitude basis. A majority of the cost of drug development is phase III studies - a quick google search quotes a cost of around $20,000 per patient, with around 4,000 patients in a study. These are some serious ballpark numbers, but it tells us that the quote isn't totally off base. Of course, as with any project, it's easier to look forward and quote $150 million than it is to finish under that number.

The real cost of drug discovery is not in the successes, but in the failures. Once again, it's easy to look at the very impressive early successes for this compound and think ""what could go wrong,"" but the same is said about any drug that makes it even into Phase I. If the consensus is ""it's probably just going to tank in phase II,"" why follow it?

I don't think you can enforced a law for patient compliance.  You can, however, make it to where only the hospital can administer the compound, perhaps intravenously, but that just shuffles more cost onto the patient.

"Pharmacy student here. Most of the newer antibiotics are for very serious infections (ESBLs, bacteremia caused by MRSA/VRSA/etc.) that are only really treated on an in-patient basis.

Patient compliance with IV formulations is a non-issue &amp; a lot of hospitals are starting to hire infectious disease pharmacists into positions called ""antimicrobial stewardships"". In these positions, the pharmacists keep an eye on all the antibiotics being prescribed &amp; dispensed inside of a hospital in order to make sure that certain antibiotics aren't being over prescribed or that the ""big guns"" (Vanc. or Zosyvn) aren't being used for a non-MRSA strain of *S. aureus*",swissarmybromance,2015-01-07 16:16:40
"I would want to hear what a lawyer has to say on the legality of that kind of thing. But as someone who works in medicine, I can say that we do implement this on ourselves sometimes. Some hospitals or hospital systems have ""gatekeepers"" for certain antibiotics. For instance, linezolid is a big gun antibiotic with activity against MRSA that we use in severe infections, especially in an icu patients, when there's reasons we can't use vancomycin, which is the go to MRSA big gun. But the infectious disease specialists have to be consulted on the case and they have to prescribe it. This is just a self-moderation my hospital system does. And to be honest, I think it probably is done more so because linezolid is crazy expensive, rather than out of concern for resistance. 

Of course, there's also the system like we have in place for chemo drugs. You have to have a special license and be trained in oncology to prescribe many of them. I could foresee a future where, if things get dire enough, antibiotic prescriptions could become highly regulated. At least our big guns. ",STXGregor,2015-01-07 17:25:41

I was wondering what conferred the antibiotic-producing organism resistance when (to paraphrase) ""no bacteria will readily evolve resistance to this new molecule without serious evolution away from the current cell wall structure"" that the articles are saying.

"That still doesn't rule out natural resistance out there.  

Both penicillin and lysozyme  have similar targets to this molecule and are produced by eukaryotic organisms that are innately immune to their effects.  In spite of that, bacteria have widespread defenses against these molecules in the form of beta-lactamase and various [lysozyme defenses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146533).
",DanHeidel,2015-01-07 13:22:15
"Part of the difference in the target is this new antibiotic doesn't seem to target proteins, rather it targets the precursor of some step of some process the bacteria uses (forgotten what it was exactly), this causes a build up of toxic chemicals, consequently killing the bacteria. 

Basically, I don't know much about this but I do medicinal chemistry but, I'm fairly certain developing resistance to something like this is much harder than a random mutation of protein-enzyme structure, which happens all the time. 

[Here's](http://ge.tt/8NbwM982/v/0) the full article if you're interested, as my explanation was rather poor, in case you don't have access.

Edit: Here's a long quote from their discussion on resistance developing:

&gt;This suggests that the producer does not employ an alternative path- way for cell wall synthesis that would protect it from teixobactin, and which other bacteria could borrow. Resistance could eventually emerge from horizontal transmission of a resistance mechanism from some soil bacterium, and given the highly conserved teixobactin binding motif, this would likely take the form of an antibiotic modifying enzyme. How- ever, although determinants coding for enzymes attacking frequently found antibiotics such as b-lactams or aminoglycosides are common, they are unknown for the rare vancomycin. The recently discovered teixobactin is even less common than vancomycin. After its introduc- tion into the clinic, it took 30 years for vancomycin resistance to appear29. The lipid II modification pathway resulting in vancomycin resistance probably originated in the producer of vancomycin, Amycolatopsis orientalis19. It will probably take even longer for resistance to the better-protected teixobactin to emerge. Teixobactin is the first mem- ber of a new class of lipid II binding antibiotics, structurally distinct from glycopeptides, lantibiotics30,31, and defensins32. The properties of teixobactin suggest that it evolved to minimize resistance development by target microorganisms. It is likely that additional natural compounds with similarly low susceptibility to resistance are present in nature and are waiting to be discovered.

Don't get me wrong either, it doesn't suggest that resistance will *never* develop, just seems like it may take longer. And what's more exciting, as has been pointed out in the thread, is the method. This is just one discovered compound from one bacteria (though they found 25 other compounds from other bacteria, this was just the most promising), so consequently it suggests we may be able to find lots more compounds which are just as efficacious if not more-so due to this new technique. Quite cool stuff.",Sigfund,2015-01-07 15:46:04
"Thanks, this is a really good paper.

I would agree that spontaneous resistance is going to be difficult for this compound.  However, it is entirely possible that specific evolved defenses against it - as with Vancomycin - are out there.  This chemical arms race has been going on for a long time.  It may take a long while for any evolved resistance to pop up but IMO, it's a bit presumptuous of the authors to assume that something out there hasn't figured out a counter to this.  

Also, I would also counter their assertion that the teixobactin conserved binding motif is a guarantee against spontaneous resistance.  Chloramphenicol has a mode of action where it chemically modifies the 23S rRNA, inactivating it.  Spontaneous resistance isn't that uncommon despite the highly conserved nature of rRNA.

Still, this look like a really promising drug and the methodology for its discovery is going to be extremely useful.",DanHeidel,2015-01-07 18:03:50

This particular antibiotic affects peptidoglycan, or rather, one of the building blocks of peptidoglycan. G-ve bacteria don't have peptidoglycan (well they have a tiny bit, but further inside the cell wall where its hard to reach) and thus aren't affected.

"You are right in that there have been a ton of derivative compounds made to combat resistance in the last 30 years, but in the last 20 there have only been 2 new drug classes that have actually been generated-daptomycin and linezolid.  Linezolid has a new structure but a tried and true mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis-which we know resistance to can evolve significantly.  


Daptomycin is a much more novel mechanism of action and has seen less resistance, although some has been noted.  So that is a new drug class with a pretty neat mechanism.


Teixobactin appears to be a Lipid II modification antagonist with no protein binding affinity.  It has a novel chemical architecture and a mechanism of action that is more difficult to grow resistance to (likely) than a proteib-based target.  Vancomycin is similar in many ways, and has taken 30 years before resistance really mounted against it so.  These lipid precursors to cell wall components are potentially exciting targets because unlike bacterial proteins, they can not be easily modified to develop resistance by a single or a few point mutations.  Likely, they would require modification of the metabolic pathways involved in the construction of the lipids and the cell wall-which requires more lucky jumps in evolution than modifications to a single enzyme.  So I at least think this drug class is kind of neat.


That being said, the impact of this paper likely won't be the teixobactin, it will likely instead be the ability to screen secondary metabolites from non-culturable bacterial to screen for drug potential in a meaningful way.  As it stands, this particular technology will have finite abilities in high-throughput screening, but now that it is published there will large modifications to the general protocol to improve the types of activities selected for as well as the microbe-samples tested.

&gt;&gt;It is true that a ton of our antibiotic producing microbes come from the soil, but we &gt;&gt;simply can't grow 99% of them in lab (like the article said). With this technique if it &gt;&gt;becomes possible to screen a much larger percentage of soil microbes it could &gt;&gt;unveil a ton of new compounds to study and potentially create drugs from.

Is this case significantly different? 

Does new anti biotic mean that bacteria that have become resistant to older anti biotics aren't resistant to the newer one?",Uhu_ThatsMyShit,2015-01-07 13:14:06
"In that large list, a lot of the drugs are modifications of a similar drug to give it slightly different properties. I'm on mobile so I can't comment to the resistance with certainty, but if it has a similar mechanism to another class, it's possible that there will still be resistance despite being a new drug. If it's a new mechanism of action it's still possible that resistance exists, but less likely. It also may not be active against certain bacteria so the usefulness may be very wide or very limited. The interesting part is the new method of discovery and if this could lead to the discovery of more antibiotics.",seb101189,2015-01-07 13:38:52

A fecal transplant is given to those (usually) who's gut flora doesn't come back to normal, and as a result develops reoccurring infections. at the moment the fecal transplant is sort of performed as an enema - but they are developing a pill that is taken orally that would do the same job.

"I don't know the guidelines at work say under 2-4 i think we don't even bother testing it, because young people can't really ""get"" C.diff - things like rotovirus, etc are much more common. 


with a c.diff infection - C.diff is largely opportunistic, and if antibiotics are being taken, it can wipe out the normal flora and allow it to colonize, but 9/10 times once you cease antibiotic treatment, normal flora should take hold again. 

I'm would doubt the lactose intoerance, and probiotics working have much to do with C.diff. 
Lactose intolerance, depending on ethinc background is pretty common, (and imo more ""normal"" than to have lactose tolerance and a lot of it comes with age.) Probiotics when stopped making you feel sick, i'd also say is unlikely to be C.diff (its only considered normal flora in about 5% of people) which is why its generally thought of as a nosocomial disease. as it spreads quickly in immunosuppressed people (those taking anti-biotics)  Probiotics, are made to make people feel ""better"" so removing that its understandable that you would being to feel worse.

"Well, my personal thought is that I wasn't even remotely lactose intolerant prior to the c. diff infection, and then I suddenly was afterwards. I'm also white, don't have much lactose intolerance in my family, and I'm only 20. Like I said, I've had a few recurrences with c. Diff infection. They all happened after I ran out/stopped taking my probiotics. Then I had to go through another round of Flagyl to bring it back under control. My theory is that the c. diff hasn't been fully removed from my system, so it can take back over when I stop the probiotics. Something else, too, is that c. diff infection just feels differently than your normal sickness. When I had it, I knew it, it was completely different than any other digestive problems I have experienced. ",Rivers_On_Fire,2015-01-07 16:20:21

Also, my symptoms disappeared within three days and haven't recurred in over two years. Metronidazole and vancomycin didn't do that -- they required weeks of treatment, several pills a day, and it usually didn't work 100% anyway. ",kh9hexagon,2015-01-08 00:21:49

"Fecal transplantation has also advanced to being able to be taken in capsule form, rather than having to be transplanted into the GI tract.

With a 90%+ success rate in trials, I would say that using non-pathogenic bacteria to outcompete pathogens has a bright future. Resistance is much harder to develop in this case, if what is used to combat it can also evolve at the same rate (or even faster if forced to).

The problem with that is we are not going to be able to create consistent or mass-produced fecal pellets. We would have to isolate and produce the ""ideal"" combination and proportion of certain bacteria, which would have to be controlled and require a lot more research until it is viable for mass-production of probiotic therapy.",craznazn247,2015-01-08 02:26:39
My understanding is that C. diff is not hard to treat initially. It's hard to prevent recurrent infections due to it's capability of forming spores and the lack of specificity of drugs that destroy the microbial flora to resist C. diff colonization. They did not report activity against spores and performed their in-vivo tests with S. aureus. Still super exciting though. ,sekoye,2015-01-07 13:40:13

One of the worst cases of this I've heard is fish farms that basically use vast net baskets out in the ocean to contain thousands upon thousands of caught fish. If one fish gets a bacterial infection it will spread like wildfire, so the fish farms literally pump antibiotics into these parts of the ocean to keep all their livestock healthy.

"Microbiology PhD student here... Seeing the headline made me immediately skeptical, and I figured this was blown out of proportion, but it actually sounds pretty promising.

Long story short, they were able to isolate a naturally-produced antibiotic from the soil that works similarly to a previously discovered antibiotic (vancomycin, which they mention in paper). The cool thing is that this compound is able to kill bacteria that have acquired vancomycin resistance, which is promising. 

This is still no silver bullet, though. It doesn't look like it's effective against Gram-negative bacteria, which comprise a bunch of pathogens. Against MRSA, though, this could be great. 

I'm sure resistance can and will crop up, but the exciting thing is we know enough to hopefully be more responsible implementing new antibiotics. They give the example that it took 30 years for clinical resistance to vancomycin to crop up, so with proper use this could last just as long if not longer. Which is awesome.

The similar drug I mentioned, and the paper mentioned, (vancomycin) acts on the same component of a bacterium, and resistance was developed against that. While it looks true that this new drug works against bacteria that are resistant to vancomycin, that doesn't mean bacteria won't find another way.

"Good question!

(This is just educated guessing on my part, if anyone has a reference to prove me wrong or right, that would be awesome). 

These antibiotic compounds in the soil are likely there in very low concentrations, and may not even be produced to kill, maybe just more of a warning molecule. So in the soil, resistance would likely be slower to develop. But depending on how long these compounds have been produced, resistance is bound to crop up. It's a selective pressure, and microbes will find a way to survive it.

In a human, we are going to be pumping in a lot of antibiotic because we want all of the pathogenic bacteria dead. This will create quite a strong selective pressure, promoting evolution of resistance. The problem here, as opposed to the soil, is likely we are selecting for a pathogen to become resistant to an antibiotic, whereas in the soil it would be a small amount of whatever native bacterium that becomes resistance.

"Also most antibiotics used in animal husbandry are outdated for human use (like most tetracyclines or beta-lactam). Of course you still create gene-reservoirs for antibiotic-resistance and enable gene-transfers, but the pure weight of doses is not a really good indicator.
Nonetheless anitibiotics need to be more regulated and I completely agree with this direction.

e: As some of you have mentioned: I'm talking about EU regulations, should have made this more clear. I'm not an expert in antibiotic administration in the US. Of course there are still many  tetracyclines and beta-lactams prescribed for human use and I didn't mean to evaluate every single variation (which is quite a task).

important antimicrobials: http://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/i0204e/i0204e00.pdf

The general point that mostly ""older"" antibiotics are used still stands, but ,as I mentioned earlier, there is still a high risk for transferability.

The dramatic increase in the number of species and genera that have acquired tetracycline resistance since the 1950s has led to a reduction in the efficacy and use of current tetracycline therapy for many diseases.""

Alongside that there must be enforcement of that legislation - if a doctor knowingly endangered the life of one patient their license to practice would be at risk; if they knowingly endanger the life of all humans by over/mis - prescribing antimicrobials the consequences should be the same.  

i would personally go as far as to outright ban the use of human-critical antimicrobials on any other species.  No animals life is worth the consequences of resistance.  There is a great deal of resistance to this idea in the veterinary community however.  Most veterinary practice is privately owned so there is some financial incentive to overprescribe - this must be regulated and zero (or very small) markups enforced for these drugs.

Also there must be greater public education of antimicrobial resistance - people have often vaguely heard of it but are unaware of how bad the situation already is, or how they may be contributing to it.  ",alsiola,2015-01-07 13:34:06

"Edit: /u/foggyforests, this is in response to your post but I think it got lost in the shuffle!

It is. I've been sick for about a month and am on my 3rd antibiotic, augmentin, for a bad sinus infection. I am one of those people who are resistant to antibiotics like  azithromycin for secondary infections from upper respiratory infections. And there's a reason:

I'm a nurse. I've worked in hospitals 30+ years, exposed to every bug imaginable. I don't smoke, but I do have asthma. Despite the infection control precautions hospitals employ, to keep healthcare workers and other patients safe from passing infections to others, germs spread everywhere. But that's another topic for another day.

This breakthrough will be huge if it truly provides medication to treat TB, which at this point requires 6 months to a year or more of oral meds. C. diff is just an awful, awful infection that is not common in the general population but is common in debilitated people like nursing home residents and chronically ill hospital patients. Ironically, c. diff usually occurs after patients have been on antibiotics for other illnesses.

This  drug as mentioned in the article, will be battling big time illnesses, and it is bound to have some heavy side effects, despite the statement about mice not experiencing any. I think that will be the catch here. It may become a wonderfully curative drug, but then so is intravenous [vancomycin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin), which has some horrible side effects.

That's what I do as a nurse; I place [PICC lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripherally_inserted_central_catheter) for people who have to go home on weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy (or take chemo or TPN etc).

"Not to take away from Kim Lewis's group (who are great colleagues), but this title is really bothering me. It is not the first antibiotic discovered in the last 30 years. [Cubist Pharmaceuticals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubist_Pharmaceuticals) has discovered a few and brought 2 to market just this year! Cubicin was technically discovered in the 80s but was approved in 2003. 

I would also like to point out that discovery of an antibiotic is not the same thing as developing an approved drug. I am on a team that has discovered quite a few novel antibiotics just this year! It's just that those novel compounds tend to be really toxic and make crappy drugs, so they get shelved. But they are still novel antibiotics discovered. Kim Lewis's drug, on the other hand, looks pretty great but it still has to pass phase 1-3 trials. Many drugs that look great initially end up not being very safe.

"Antibiotics found in nature are the natural chemical warfare agents that microbes produce to kill each other when they can't get along as neighbors.  

The problem with isolating and producing them on a mass scale is that these chemical agents have existed in nature for a very long time, meaning some species have already grown adaptations to avoid or mitigate their effects.  Use one antibiotic too frequently and you just select for these resistant species to survive. 

You can modify and tweak the chemical structure of the antibiotic for efficacy, but this is only delaying the inevitable.  All of them will lose efficacy over time as evolution selects for more resistant pathogens.  These drugs aren't the drugs of the future, but a temporary stopgap measure until we can come up with something *really* effective.

Imagine friendly and harmless designer microbes that can reside in certain spaces of your body.  They're built from the ground up to be incredibly resistant to mutation (too much deviation in the genetic code and they kills themselves).  They don't irritate the immune system and they don't produce toxic effects in humans. Their sole job is to take up residence and prevent other microbes (the real bad guys) from setting in. 

One day in the far future an advanced humanity might inoculate themselves with several designer strains of helpful bacteria that colonize the human body and stay there for life, keeping the host safe from infection.",coastermonger,2015-01-07 13:58:11

"The reason they hope this is less prone to have bacteria develop resistance is based on an experiment they perform in the paper and the fact that teixo targets a cell wall component, as you mention.

In short, *Staph aureus* was grown in media containing the drug over many days and never developed resistance.

The targeting of the cell wall is hard to develop resistance against because it's not a protein and thus not directly coded for in a gene. This means that a point mutation or two in a protein isn't likely to delete an active site, like it might if the drug targeted a protein.

Instead, bacteria will need to evolve a protein that attacks the antibiotic, like the bacterial enzyme Beta-lactamase attacks the chemical structure of penicillin-like antibiotics.

If teixobactin is being secreted in nature by a microbe, it's likely other bacteria have evolved enzymes to stop it.

",GnomeCzar,2015-01-07 12:45:55
"Yes exactly. And because the mechanism of action is against the cell wall, the drug does not need to enter the cytoplasm in order to be efficacious. If that was required, like most antibiotics, then the bacteria could have mutations in efflux pumps which  then could pump out the antibiotics to protect itself. It's harder to protect against something that doesn't need to physically enter your cell in order to kill you. ",smashy_smashy,2015-01-07 14:23:05
"Thanks for the explanation.  When you say that bacteria would have to ""instead"" evolve a protein that attacks the antibiotic itself the way bacteria have for penicillin and its ilk, doesn't that mean teixobactin no less susceptible to resistance than penicillin was?",78fivealive,2015-01-07 13:22:21
"I think you're right on track.

It's possible to co-administer a drug that will inhibit the bacterial enzymes responsible for breaking down the antibiotic. This is why amoxicillin is sometimes administered with clavunlanic acid.

"It was actually extensively tested with S. aureus already in this paper and no resistant strains were found to develop. They also tested directly against MRSA (resistant S. aureus) and found high efficacy. From the original journal article in Nature:

&gt;An animal efficacy study was then performed in a mouse septicemia model. Mice were infected intraperitoneally with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at a dose that leads to 90% of death. One hour post-infection, teixobactin was introduced i.v. at single doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg per kg. All treated animals survived (Fig. 4a), and in a subsequent experiment the PD50 (protective dose at which half of the animals survive) was determined to be 0.2 mg per kg, which compares favourably to the 2.75 mg per kg PD50 of vancomycin, the main antibiotic used to treat MRSA.

That is to say, they lethally infected mice with MRSA, and teixobactin cured it in all cases. Very good news.

"&gt;âI must tell you, my first impression about this compound was that it is boring,â said Kim Lewis, director of the Antimicrobial Discovery Center at Northeastern. Thatâs because the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and staph infections did not develop resistance to the molecule, which is often a sign that the possible drug is simply toxic to all cells.

&gt;Then Lewis and his colleagues tested its toxicity against mammalian cells and found that it didnât kill them. They also discovered that teixobactin had a new way of killing bacteria, by inhibiting the building of the cell wall.

"Is it inevitable that antibiotics (as a whole) will become obsolete? Can discoveries like this do more than just prolong the inevitable?

Could we reach a point where we have ""enough"" antibiotics? If bacteria become resistant the more we use an antibiotic, would an old antibiotic become useful again if we stop using it for a while? Could we reasonably develop enough antibiotics that we can cycle them in and out of use so that we can use them indefinitely? Alternatively, could there be too many antibiotics for a bacteria to be resistant to all of them? Or could we develop a 1-2 punch where one antibiotic encourages a trait that leaves the bacteria vulnerable to the second?",Ra_In,2015-01-07 16:18:52

If new classes of antibiotics were found as effective or even more effective than currently used classes and we discontinued use of older classes, would the bacteria be likely to lose their resistance to the discontinued classes of antibiotics?

If so, would it be possible to cycle classes every XX years in order to keep bacterial resistance to a minimum?",howdydoesit,2015-01-07 12:40:55
"This is reminiscent of a ""talmudic"" question you might see at [Small Things Considered](http://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/talmudic_questions/).

I think yeah, if we removed selective pressure by taking a class of antibiotic off the market, eventually they'd drift out of producing effective resistance genes. 

The timescale would probably be impractically long, though.",GnomeCzar,2015-01-07 12:53:45
"Why would it take impractically long?  If it develops a resistance so quickly, why would it necessarily take a long time?  Is there a limit on how much different types of resistances a bacteria can have?",kicktriple,2015-01-07 13:19:10
"Resistance is fast because if a bug doesn't have resistance it dies and can't reproduce. Soon the bugs that have resistance are all that's left, and they're the only ones reproducing.

Losing resistance is slow, because it doesn't matter if you have it or not. It's like having the ability to curl your tongue or an attached earlobe; traits that have very little effect on fitness. So, bugs with resistance and bugs without resistance will both grow. 

Now say 99.9999% of a population of bacteria have evolved away from resistance and 0.0001% are still resistant. What's going to happen when you reintroduce the antibiotic?

BTW, there's no hard limit on the number of genes a bacteria can have that I'm aware of, but there is a real metabolic maintenance cost to having lots of genetic material.

edit: more words (99.9999% sentence)",GnomeCzar,2015-01-07 13:28:33
"&gt;The timescale would probably be impractically long, though.

Supposedly this particular antibiotic has an attack mechanism that would be incredibly difficult to develop resistance to, and the researchers are throwing around lengths of time like ""30 years"" before such a thing could happen.

***If*** that were the case, would 30 years of removing a bunch of antibiotics from general use be sufficient to remove antibiotic resistance from these bacteria in the wild?

Would they be able to re-develop it faster after reintroduction of the formerly ineffective antibiotic?",,2015-01-07 17:52:30
"There was a study done that showed that certain bacteria lose resistance to certain antibiotics over time.  The gist is that increased resistance to antibiotics makes them less efficient, so without selective pressures, they evolve to lose these resistances.

"Unfortunately most antibacterials are produced by other organisms in nature, so even if we stop using it it is still likely the resistance will stay out there.

"Undoubtedly, if this is all true AND the drug ACTUALLY gets approved, this will be huge.  However I can't help feeling that trying to advance antibiotics is rooted in science that we are beginning to think much differently about.  I recently saw a talk on targeting essential pathways unique to C. diff, very similarly to how we use small molecules to selectively inhibit enzymes in certain types of cancer.  These approaches take advantage of selectivity and a low off-target profile (or so we think).  We have the know how and the power to design all sorts of selective molecules for different bacterial strains and their essential pathways, yet there's still focus on finding the antibiotic ""panacea"" for all bacterial infections.

The problem with this approach is that the natural microbiome, or the ""good bacteria"" that live in our bodies, are also susceptible to these sorts of antibiotics.  So therefore you have come in with a brute force approach (antibiotics) that don't discriminate between good and bad bacteria.  This is because a lot of these molecules work by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, or ribosomal protein translation.  Every bacteria gets killed to a certain extent and the balance of bacteria in the body is tilted.

We have no reason to believe they wouldn't go back to previous frequencies if that selection pressure was removed and given a sufficient amount of time.

What does this mean? It means that the problem is not irreversible, and thus not as exciting. Given enough concerted effect, cycling enough antibiotics seems to be a very viable long-term option. We've already figured out using antibiotics in some combinations, using higher doses, etc. help fight resistance.

"Medicine takes SERIOUS time to get real results. If someone has an idea for a new tablet interface- like when touch screens evolved practically overnight with fantastic technology- it didn't matter that the first generation of innovation wasn't perfect. Patches could be inserted in and the turnover of tech for a consumer is always crazy high.

In medicine it's way different. You have to identify a problem/pathway, figure out how to model a disease in culture or in some other way, maybe trial thousands of different drug structures in a computer bank, then see if they can be developed, then maybe test them in animal models, then people, etc. etc. 

There's also the major issue of many different labs operating relatively independently. Most stuff is grant based. Big pharm companies pump in money for more drugs to be milled out because that behooves them in the short run. Labs like this one had to fight for recognition then apply for grants to pursue this particular project. They probably were distracted by ten other projects while doing this because they have to keep their lab in the green. Plus, you don't want to/can't afford bringing in lots of other help or else you'll be scooped. And you're not worried about that for name recognition, you're worried about it most of all for job security.

It's really really stressful.

I also have the opinion that there is a serious disparity between the biological world and every other industry in terms of type of mentality. There was a really cool breakthrough in stem cells at almost the same time. One group did a brute force test that looked at basically every possible gene candidate while trying to figure out how to create stem cells. Another group just used a computer algorithm to narrow the pool down to 9 genes, and tested those. They came out with the same results.

Again, this part of my post is just opinion, but I feel like the grant funded (i.e., not privatized) basis of the industry along with the very biologically based way of schooling (I know many grad students in Neuro that don't know a lick of programming, which is weird to me), it's just apples and oranges when compared to any other field.

The synthesis part is commonly known as the Calvin cycle as referred by the poster above. This cycle is actually individual chemical reactions that lead to the production of sugars that plants can use. It takes the chemical energy and turns it into larger molecular energy.

"DNA is like our library of evolution. About the only way we know of that we can get the information in that library is to get it from our mom and dad (but see epigenetics)--each parent giving us half the books in our own personal library. Every cell in the body contains a complete library that is somewhat redundant having two copies of each book although the two copies are somewhat different, but sperm and eggs each have half a library that can be passed on to children. 

What has happened to us over generations and indeed back to our bacterial ancestors is reflected in our DNA. The DNA (evolutionary library) is divided into genes that are something like books in the library. Sometimes people say the book or gene is the fundamental unit of inheritance.

It's been known for some time that these slugs can steal parts of plant cells called chloroplasts where sunlight is turned into energy (food, calories). What we did not know is that these slugs can actually steal a book from the plants library thus taking the information from their evolutionary history to use for their own advantage.

We have known that bacteria do this book stealing from each other all the time. Because they use the same language in their books as we do in ours, we have been able to use the tricks bacteria use to swap books (genes) in the laboratory between libraries (animals, plants, bacteria, etc) and thus we have GMOs.

It's surprisingly easy to incorporate bits of DNA, that is parts of books or even whole books, into DNA.

There's a bit of a debate between secondary or tertiary plastid acquisition happening via stable endosymbiosis (whole organism living within its host) or kleptoplasty (the plastid being stolen many, many times with necessary genes for keeping it longer eventually accumulating to the point that the plastids can be maintained indefinitely).",PsiWavefunction,2015-02-04 07:19:33

As for the whole stable endosymbiosis vs kleptoplasty debate, I think there's good evidence for both happening in nature. As for which mechanism is most common, I don't know for sure, but based on the fact that in many cases of secondary and tertiary plastid acquisition, the plastid is enveloped by many layers of membranes and also contains the remnant nucleus (called a nucleomorph) which contains it's own genes, I suspect endosymbiosis is the most common mechanism.

This mutation is more likely to be carried over to the next generation due to its increased chance of survival. This does not seem to fall outside of the realm of natural selection.

As for the cyanobacteria, I am not sure if Kleptoplasty destroys the original organism. If this is the case, it provides a very slight negative pressure on mutations that allow Kleptoplasty. This pressure is very small due to the high population of cyanobacteria in the ocean.

The chloroplast, on the other hand, has its own DNA, although it currently does not have any advantageous mutations to facilitate Kleptoplasty and allow the chloroplast to survive indefinitely. In the future, when such a mutation occurs, it will be subject to natural selection. That is assuming the chloroplast can do anything to ensure its survival.",Hyperion__,2015-02-03 19:50:57

&gt;This biological adaptation is also a mechanism of rapid evolution, Pierce says. âWhen a successful transfer of genes between species occurs, evolution can basically happen from one generation to the next,â he notes, rather than over an evolutionary time scale of thousands of years.

Obviously natural selection is still happening but that's not what you asked and it's not what this article is about. *Does the incorporation of someone else's chloroplast let this slug do an end run around natural selection?* For that question we'll have to decide if sucking in a big piece of an alga's work is a full jump or within the usual realm. This is a definitional problem, and technically we could redefine selection bigger to include this, but this certainly isn't the incremental change/selective challenge pattern we all think of.

I'd say since the slug never refined itself toward producing chloroplasts - since it just steals them whole - this is clearly not a selection driven change. I could have my mind changed though if there are lots of kinds of slugs that incorporate algae/algae parts/algal genes in some way or another, any kind of behavior near to this one.

If there were lots of slugs doing something just like, well maybe not just like, but almost, kind of, like this. If this slug is just the crest of a wave of evolutionary efforts in this direction.

"You're conflating selection, mutation, and the response to selection. Selection doesn't cause mutation - there is no 'selection driven change' that incorporating a chloroplast gene could be labelled as. Selection sorts the variation that mutation creates when that variation has an impact on fitness. The horizontal gene transfer in this situation is just another kind of mutation, and selection acts upon it just as it does any other mutation. It's a complex mutation that results in dramatic and immediate novel function which is rare (as are all beneficial mutations), but it is not unusual. Whilst the chloroplast genes were not refined by selection in the slug up until this point, they very much were in the algae and in the chloroplast's free-living ancestors. We've known about dramatic mutations like HGT and transposon insertions for a long time, and they don't do anything strange with regards to selection.

Additionally, our [best hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis) of how mitochondria and chloroplasts came to be in the first place is wholesale theft (or perhaps kidnapping). Just as in this slug, there are mitochondrial and chloroplast genes in all their host genomes that were transferred horizontally.

In my mind the cool thing about this isn't that endosymbiotic gene transfer has happened (although it is very cool that it came from the algal genome and not the chloroplast directly) - we've always known it does - but that we've caught it in the act of happening.

"&gt; I have never heard horizontal gene transfer - itself - called mutation. Mutation can happen during the process but that's not what we're talking about here.

If you're not comfortable calling it a mutation (though I would argue strongly that it is a mutation just like any other insertion) it still doesn't change the equivalence of HGT with any mutation when discussing how selection acts.

&gt; I am not a slug geneticist, and it would appear no one else ITT is either. So we'll have to go with what the paper says: Multicellular -&gt; multicellular has never been seen before.

The source being multicellular doesn't change the nature of the genomic change - a large insertion of complex genetic element that has previously been shaped by selection in another context - and that's what's not unusual. With regards to selection it's irrelevant whether the source was multicellular, unicellular, a virus, or a transposon. Not to say it's not cool that it was multicellular, but the novelty doesn't have anything to do with natural selection.

&gt; Right, which is why we're getting into the fine-grained definitional questions here.

I'm not seeing what the question is - the standard definition of selection isn't inconsistent with what you've quoted or what this study shows.",cardboard_dinosaur,2015-02-04 11:24:06

"I don't mean to come off as rude but I don't think you fully understand the subject material. 

&gt;An evolutionary mechanic outside natural selection would be pretty exciting. 

Yes it would. It exists. It's called artificial selection and is the reason we have such variety in domesticated animals. Artificial selection is an evolutionary mechanic in that it is a driving force behind the evolution of different traits in certain circumstances. Such as calmer, stupider sheep and cattle.

However, what you seem to believe 'natural selection' is is the vertical transfer of genetic material from parent to offspring, which isn't the case. 

Natural selection is instead any natural pressure that causes certain genetic traits to be selected for. These traits can come about from natural point mutations (think single nucleotide changes in the DNA), larger genomic mutations (think translocation or duplication of large sections of DNA), or horizontal gene transfer (sharing genetic information between organisms, usually observed at the microbial level). 

So natural selection is a mechanism of evolution, but only in a broad sense. It seems to me that you interpret 'natural selection' to mean only the selection of vertically inherited traits. ",Nerfle,2015-02-03 20:04:55

"&gt;perhaps in a few million more generations it will develop fully into an organelle like it is theorized mitochondria and chloroplasts first evolved.

Im not sure how it works with this particular species of algae, but many genes needed for chloroplasts to replicate are located in the nuclear genome of the 'host' algae. This translocation of essential genes from ancient cyanobacteria (i.e. proto-chloroplast) to the host nuclear genome is one of the theorized mechanisms that ""enslaved"" the chloroplast and made it an organelle dependent on the host. 

So for the slug to synthesize it's own chloroplasts, it would need to incorporate many more nuclear genes from the algal prey into it's own genome. Interesting that it already seems to have acquired one gene from the algal nuclear genome, but the probability of acquiring all at once an entire suite of genes that are needed to start synthesizing chloroplasts from scratch seems very, very improbable, especially considering the relatively low number of these organelle-forming endosymbioses currently known to science",micromonas,2015-02-03 18:07:21

However, they are not entirely self-sufficient, or else they would be able to live outside of the host cell and would not be an organelle. For a really terrible metaphor, the host cell has taken essential chloroplast genes as hostages, thus keeping the organelle dependent on the host for growth.

"certainly sounds plausible to me, but since the exact mechanism behind the endosymbiotic theory is still a mystery, I suppose we can't say for certain",micromonas,2015-02-03 21:33:54
"Yup, and this is potentially an important factor in the establishment of permanent endosymbioses. You have a system that starts out with redundancies -- both organisms can function entirely on their own, and many metabolites, for example, could work for either one. Redundancy is not generally evolutionarily stable, since organisms that lose some of it through mutational damage are at no particular disadvantage to those who have the redundancy, so mutational damage persists to fixation. Your endosymbiont loses a couple pathways, your host loses a couple pathways... and voilÃ  -- you have mutual dependency, without even requiring an overall selective advantage in the process. 

We're starting to find more and more random bacterial endosymbionts in various protists. There's even intraspecific variation -- some populations within a species can have symbionts, others don't -- and some weird stuff ensures that those who do have symbionts can't easily lose them: as in the case of ""killer"" Paramecia (ciliates). The killer bacterial symbionts somehow render their hosts toxic to Paramecia who don't have those symbionts -- you can imagine how a population very quickly becomes exclusively symbiont-bearing. There's a very sharp short-term adaptive advantage to having those killers, even if they're not actually helping the host in the long run. If you lose those killers, you die. If this situation persists long enough, the killers can't live easily outside their host either. Paramecia tend to have fragmented populations, and the geography of this killer phenomenon is not understood -- but it arose many times independently, in different Paramecium species and with different bacterial phyla. But here's an example of how endosymbiosis can become fixed without even conferring an obvious long-term advantage to the host like photosynthesis would.

Also, note: traditionally, 'symbiosis' means just a close interaction between two organisms. 'mutualism' is what people usually mean by 'symbiosis' nowdays. By 'endosymbiont', I just mean 'one thing inside another' -- since the nature of many of these relationships is poorly understood, it can mean anything from rosey mutualistic friendship to vicious parasitism by one party of the other. For most of these cases, we just know that they're there.

"Furthermore, genes are necessary but not sufficient for most organelles. There's a poor studied parallel process of cellular inheritance, where structures and patterning are directly inherited from the preceding generation. Organisms and cellular contexts vary in their reliance on this (properly epigenetic) process, but there are cases where fiddling with structural organisation without affecting the genome leads to permanently heritable changes (eg. classic [Beisson + Sonneborn 1965](http://www.pnas.org/content/53/2/275.full.pdf+html)). Anyway, this seems to hold particularly true for endosymbiont-derived organelles. You need a plastid to target your plastid genes onto. Having the entire set of properly expressed genes and correctly folded proteins is still insufficient for a _de novo_ plastid or mitochondrion.

"[Horizontal gene transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) is common enough in prokaryotes, archaea, and viruses but this is the first instance I've ever seen of it occurring in a multicellular organism, and the article confirms its rarity but doesn't list any other examples.  
  
  
EDIT: From that Wikipedia article:  
  
&gt;* Analysis of DNA sequences suggests that horizontal gene transfer has occurred within eukaryotes from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to the nuclear genome. As stated in the endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts and mitochondria probably originated as bacterial endosymbionts of a progenitor to the eukaryotic cell.[37]  

&gt;* Horizontal transfer occurs from bacteria to some fungi, especially the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.[38]
&gt;* The adzuki bean beetle has acquired genetic material from its (non-beneficial) endosymbiont Wolbachia.[39] New examples have recently been reported demonstrating that Wolbachia bacteria represent an important potential source of genetic material in arthropods and filarial nematodes.[40]
&gt;* Mitochondrial genes moved to parasites of the Rafflesiaceae plant family from their hosts.[41][42] from chloroplasts of a not-yet-identified plant to the mitochondria of the bean Phaseolus,[43] and from a heterokont alga to its predator, the sea slug Elysia chlorotica.[44]
&gt;* Striga hermonthica, a eudicot, has received a gene from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) to its nuclear genome.[45] The gene is of unknown functionality.
&gt;* Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) contain multiple genes from fungi.[46][47] Plants, fungi and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene made by pea aphids is the only carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom.[46]
&gt;* The malaria pathogen Plasmodium vivax acquired genetic material from humans that might help facilitate its long stay in the body.[48]
&gt;* A bacteriophage-mediated mechanism transfers genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nuclear localization signals in bacteriophage terminal proteins (TP) prime DNA replication and become covalently linked to the viral genome. The role of virus and bacteriophages in HGT in bacteria, suggests that TP-containing genomes could be a vehicle of inter-kingdom genetic information transference all throughout evolution.[49]
&gt;* HhMAN1 is a gene in the genome of the coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) that resembles bacterial genes, and is thought to be transferred from bacteria in the beetle's gut.[50][51]
&gt;* A gene that allowed ferns to survive in dark forests came from the hornwort, which grows in mats on streambanks or trees. The neochrome gene arrived about 180 million years ago.[52]",supermegaultrajeremy,2015-02-03 17:47:07
"An example of horizontal gene transfer in humans for those interested is the ability to digest agar.  

Humans normally can't digest agar. However there are some people that can because of gene transfer between the marine bacterium *Zobellia galactanivorans* and human gut bacterium *Bacteroides
plebeius*. *Zobellia galactanivorans* has a gene that codes for porphorynase, an enzyme that digests agar, and is often found on seaweed. People who eat sushi a lot (the study was done on the gut microbiomes of Japanese citizens I believe) have been found to have *Bacteroides plebeius* with this gene, allowing for the digestion of agar. 

Where the horizontal gene transfer comes in is that the young child of a woman with this gene also possessed the gene in her gut bacteria, despite never having eaten any sushi.  The mother passed on the diversity of her gut microbiome and the ability to 'digest' agar, via birth and subsequent breastfeeding. Quotes around digest because the bacteria are doing the actual work.",DiplomaticDiplodocus,2015-02-03 19:40:46

"A new and (in my opinion) much cooler method of gene editing would be by use of a [CRISPR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) system. CRISPR provides a basic bacterial ""immune"" system by incorporating genetic information from previously encountered phages and using that information to produce templates that will allow special proteins to recognize that viral sequence and destroy it. We can take advantage of this process.


&gt;Since 2013, the CRISPR/Cas system has been used for gene editing (adding, disrupting or changing the sequence of specific genes) and gene regulation in species throughout the tree of life.[7] By delivering the Cas9 protein and appropriate guide RNAs into a cell, the organism's genome can be cut at any desired location.

&gt;It may be possible to use CRISPR to build RNA-guided gene drives capable of altering the genomes of entire populations.[8]  
  
and  
  
&gt;Editas Medicine, a $43 million startup, aims to develop treatments that employ CRISPR/Cas to make edits to single base pairs and larger stretches of DNA. Inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia are caused by single base pair mutations; CRISPR/Cas technology has the potential to correct these errors. The ""corrected"" gene remains in its normal location on its chromosome, which preserves the way the cell normally activates and/or inhibits its expression.[100]

&gt;After harvesting blood cell precursors called hematopoietic stem cells from a patient's bone marrow, CRISPR gene surgery would correct the defective gene. Then the gene-corrected stem cells would be returned to the patient's marrow, which would then produce healthy red blood cells. Replacing 70% of the sickle cells would produce a cure.[27]

&gt;Other pathologies potentially treatable by CRISPR include Huntingtonâs disease, aging, schizophrenia and autism, not to mention modifying DNA in living embryos.[27]

&gt;Improved targeting is required before CRISPR can be used in medical applications. Current guide RNAs may target sequences that differ by multiple base pairs from the intended sequence.[16]

&gt;In 2014, UCSF researchers used CRISPR to create disease-free versions of induced pluripotent stem cells of beta thalassemia patients.[101]

I haven't read  the article yet but it looks as if it was rather successful. What's special about this approach using CRISPR is the fact that with CRISPR you can do it in a multiplex fashion - meaning we have the ability to simultaneously target many, many genes - very cheaply and very quickly. It takes about 1-3 days to make a guide RNA if you're doing it manually. If you have a high throughput setup you can make thousands in no time.

"Not at all.

What happened here is called horizontal gene transfer. Which means that a gene has passed from one species to another without sex. 

It is frighteningly common among bacteria, who actually have specialized chunks of DNA called plasmids that they can exchange with each other. This is a very real concern when dealing with antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Hospitals are constantly battling bacteria that have built up resistance to different types of antibiotics. If multiple species of resistant bacteria come into contact with each other, then there's a chance that one of them will receive resistance genes from the other, resulting in a new strain that is resistant to both antibiotics.

This has occurred multiple times in hospitals around the world and now we're dealing with superbugs like Totally Drug-Resistant tuberculosis.

Among more complex organisms, HGT is much rarer but it does still happen. Most often it's caused by viruses. You probably understand the basics of how viruses work, they incorporate their DNA into the host cell's DNA. The viral DNA takes over the cell and forces it to construct more viruses to infect more cells.

Sometimes though, bits of host DNA gets mixed up in the new viruses. Additionally, sometimes when a virus inserts it's DNA into the host cell something goes wrong and it doesn't make new viruses. When these happen together, that's horizontal gene transfer.

Some bacteria are known to cause HGT as well. [Agrobacterium tumefaciens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrobacterium_tumefaciens) is one that is very frequently used in making genetically modified plants.

Some species can even preform HGT all on their own. [Bdelloid rotifers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotifer) are small organisms that commonly live in puddles. They have the ability to survive being dried out thanks to enzymes that reassemble their DNA upon rehydration. These enzymes sometimes pick up random bits and pieces of DNA from the environment. This trait has let them survive even though they lost the ability to sexually reproduce millions of years ago. By picking up random bits of DNA they're able to continue evolving even though they only reproduce asexually.

And that's just a few examples of HGT, which is just one particular evolutionary mechanism. An even faster and more common (in plants at least) mechanism is whole genome duplication.

If you cross two plant species, one of which has 10 chromosomes and the other with 12, you'll get a hybrid offspring with 11 chromosomes. This odd number can't pair off in meiosis and so the plant is sterile. To fix this, the plant will simply double it's genome and end up with 22 chromosomes.

This new plant is usually unable to reproduce with either of the parent species, so it instantly becomes a new species.",blacksheep998,2015-02-03 16:53:00

"What allows the sea slug to incorporate the DNA into its own genome, more so, how is the introduced DNA heritable?",SilentJac,2015-02-03 18:44:54
"Presumably (we can never know EXACTLY what happened), the algae made it into one of the cells in an ancestral sea slug, a cell that serves as the progenitor for that slug's reproductive cells.  This algae cell was broken open and its DNA broken up into smaller pieces.  One of these pieces contained a photosynthesis gene, which is now floating freely in the cell.

At the same moment, there may have been a double-stranded break in the sea slug cell's own DNA.  Although the cell is a dangerous environment for a small fragment of DNA, and although the fragment would've had to make it through the nuclear membrane...that photosynthesis gene makes it to this double-stranded break, and fits itself right in.  Because this cell gives rise to sperm/eggs, this insertion will carry on into the offspring of this slug.

Note that this process is *incredibly* unlikely to happen successfully, and even when it does happen, the chances that these gene is actually ""turned on"" (epigenetically activated) are still shaky.  However, it has happened in OUR ancestors time and time again!  Our mitochondria (""the powerhouse of the cell!"") almost certainly descended from full-fledged bacteria.  They contain their own very genome, made of DNA which they replicate on their own.  However, this genome is very small; the vast majority of genes important for mitochondria are located in the cell's nuclear (main) DNA.  Many of these genes closely resemble bacterial genes, supporting the idea that they showed up to our ancestor cell inside of a bacterium first and then broke off into our genome!

"At its origin, step by step, there are two models on the origin of life, the probiotic soup model, and the surface model, for simplicity, I will focus on the former, 

Electric storms in earths early life energized particles in the oceans of the earth, forming basic molecules that would give rise to amino acids, proteins, and eventually cells. Keep in mind that just because these proteins are not living does not mean that natural selection did not apply. Early cells would develop the ability to synthesis energy from light, and produce oxygen gas (!!!) which is lethal to most proteins (think oxidation), which selected protein structures that could resist these effects, usually through the development of protective shells and essentially becoming bigger proteins, which would eventually create the first predators, simple cells that were diverse enough, and large enough to engulf other cells, deriving energy by using the photosynthetic properties of the engulfed cell. This benefits the organism by making it harder to kill/starve and allowed engulfed cells to function in a (relatively) stable environment. More still would develop ways to harness the toxic properties of oxygen, breaking down existing proteins and derive energy from that (mitochondria)

Eventually, generations of manually engulfing these proto-cells somehow leads to the genetic code from them being integrated in the larger cells own DNA (a fuzzy area at best) as well as other small cells (some predatorial cells engulfed mitochondria, others chloroplasts) allowing them to survive and multiply. As they got larger, more efficient designs/configurations/interactions of these early organelles would result in the specialization of each part within the larger cell that could survive better than any individual protein could, which would create the basic cell unit you see on posters

"Not necessarily.  The fact that mitochondria, who appear to have originally have been infiltrating bacteria, survived not only the original intrusion (endocytosis) but have survived eons of evolutionary pressure, would suggest that they offered some advantage to their original hosts.  However, their original host may have carried out many of these metabolic functions themselves prior to the endocytosis event; if the primordial mitochondria made these functions redundant, they may have eventually been lost in host.  

Gene mutations happen all the time; if they have a negative impact on the host, those mutations are unlikely to pass on.  It might seem at the surface that a mutation that disables a gene would always be negative...but if that gene was redundant (doing something the mitochondria are doing for you), then there might not be any evolutionary pressure killing off those offspring who have these kinds of mutations.  The disabling mutation might even be positive, saving nutrients for other gene products to be made instead (or streamlining the metabolic process, or allowing the dangerous oxidants produced during metabolism to be confined only within your newly acquired proto-mitochondria, or many other things).  Humans (and probably all other lifeforms) have a genome that is full of these ""fossil"" genes, stretches of DNA that appear related to functional genes in other organisms but don't get used to produce gene products in us anymore.  As time goes on, countless numbers of these disabled genes have probably mutated away into something we can't even recognize as a possible gene anymore.  We throw genes by the wayside all the time, and a host who now has little slaves to make its ATP for it has an ample opportunity to do so without a negative effect.

Remember!  The host would not have been ""trying"" to lose its own metabolism genes.  Evolution has no goals or future strategies.  These mutations accidentally happened to its own genes, and nothing bad (or maybe something good) happened.",ser0tonin,2015-02-05 12:09:00

Having a buncha reverse transcriptase around means genomic DNA wasn't neccesarrily the origin of the horizontal gene transfer event.

algae can produce energy from the sun through photosynthesis like plants

slug eats algae and holds on to energy producing machinery from algae

slug has been found to have genes which allow the algae's energy producing machine to continue working for the slug

several tests were done which show the gene came from the algae, however it's thought that usually genes Do Not transfer 'horizontally' to other organisms so more specific genetic tests are needed

... the really interesting thing this brings up is that for years proponents of g.m.o foods have claimed there is no way the modified genes inserted could end up transferring to the humans or animals who eat it


http://m.pnas.org/content/105/46/17867.full

&gt;In light of these findings, the prospect of natural HGT taking place between distantly related organisms, especially with any physical contact, must be considered formally possible. This is especially true in the context of genetically modified organisms

So does this mean that the slugs have also formed a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria at the cellular level, or does it mean that the slugs actually nabbed the DNA and make the chloroplasts themselves? ",kodack10,2015-02-04 09:27:49

the developing young slugs eat the algae and squirrel away the algae's chloroplasts... but they wouldn't be able to use it without a certain gene product to control it

Our know how to take a bacteria and alter it to make it perform a certain function is a lot better. We also know how organelles are set up in a general sense.

Also because there are hundreds of billions of galaxies it would take millions of years traveling at light speed to travel between them. We also forget how short of a time we've been around.

"*Capable of supporting life* is generally used to mean that the planet/moon/body has the elements required for life to form. From a scientific perspective, life comes to being by chance chemical reactions that occur when these elements are able to interact with each other. Life on Earth, for example, is thought to have from from the simple, abundant elements Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Oxygen connecting to each other in various forms of various complexity. Over the last 4 billion years, this has led us from simple, self-replicating molecules (the precursors to life were likely chains of molecules very similar to DNA) to things as complex and diverse as chimpanzees or squid.  

If this sounds a little complex and crazy, that's because it might be. It could be that life on Earth is a freak phenomenon that doesn't happen often at all, and that we are alone in the universe for all intents and purposes. It could be that it is exceedingly common given the right conditions - and what we *think* are the right conditions are the ones we just found on Enceladus. The right elements, heat, and moving water. The thing is, we just don't know how common life is, even given the perfect conditions.  

So, it could be that Enceladus is *capable* of supporting life - it has all the right conditions - but those *chance* chemical reactions haven't occurred there in the right order, timing, rates, or whatever - we don't know what could go wrong, we've never seen life somewhere else before.

what about the gravity ? Doesn't life need gravity ?,k0ntrol,2015-03-11 16:56:05
"In the same spirit as my above comment, I have to say that is really difficult to determine. Like /u/iObeyTheHivemind said, life that is ""human-like"" will probably come to be in gravity situations similar to Earth's, i.e. Venus, Mars, or somewhat larger than Earth sizes.  

However, the chemical reactions we think give rise to life do not require gravity, they just require the chemicals are close enough together and have enough energy (almost certainly in the form of heat). That's part of why this moon is so great - it has thermal vents, which is to say it is leaking heat out of its core. It also has water, which necessary for life that is Earth-like, and water holds / moves the chemicals that give rise to life.  

One theory of life on Earth is that it came from an asteroid impact - something with very low gravity (because it would be relatively small) smashed into us, but was carrying the organic molecules that give rise to life on it. We have seen the basic building blocks for proteins, which govern almost everything a cell does, arrive from space. This theory is called [Panspermia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia).",yesitsnicholas,2015-03-11 19:35:10
"Not that I disagree with you, I don't, but we can't reproduce life on earth with only organic elements, granted we made amino acids though.

Feel free to prove me wrong. ",k0ntrol,2015-03-12 01:09:06
"Life is expected to take millions - billions of years to arise from organic compounds, which is likely why we haven't seen it happen in the lab yet. Of course, the amount of gravity in our labs is identical to the amount of gravity on Earth, given that the labs are on Earth. Maybe we need less gravity! Maybe more. We have no idea, but I (personally) think it's safe to say it's not very important for the beginning of life whether one is in a high or low gravity situation.  

Also, I think it's just worth bringing up that whether life is on Enceladus or not doesn't *prove* anything, it will strongly suggest probabilities though. But that's somewhat jargon-y of me to say.",yesitsnicholas,2015-03-12 09:28:18

Take the photo from this post for example. As a living being, observing a photograph of another world and examining it for life, wouldn't you expect there to be some visual indication of organic processes taking place? At least the appearance of different environments? 

I look at this very high quality photograph and it just looks dead to me. I realize colors have been saturated and this is not a true to life image, but still. There just doesn't seem to be any visual evidence of any type of nature. As opposed to a picture of Earth with a similar quality, where one could easily see from the photo that the planet itself is alive, let alone the beings that live on its surface and in the oceans.

"[Cassini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens) has been in orbit about Saturn since 2004, it was the first to discover and image Enceladus's ""tiger stripes"", the surface features corresponding to the vent openings. [image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Enceladusstripes_cassini.jpg).

Cassini has several chemistry experiments onboard which have been able to detect the listed chemicals in Enceladus's plume, and tracking of its orbal velocity during flybys of Enceladus has provided us with evidence of a low density (water is less dense than rock) region centered on the south pole. 

Edit - actually I think the south polar region is over-dense, due to having a volume full of liquid water rather than ice. Of course water is denser than ice, which is why icebergs float. There's a paper floating around the internet that came out about a year ago detailing the gravity measurements that one should be able to easily find on google to get some more info on the topic.",sexual_pasta,2015-03-11 14:58:10

Art can be whatever you want obviously, but part of photographing nature is capturing its beauty for others to experience. I feel that post-processing is disingenuous to that experience.

(The colors could be off if you didn't tweak the settings *just* right or the white balance could be messed up or the photo isn't as sharp as it should be. All of those things can be fixed in post to match what they were supposed to be. Anyway my point is don't get disappointing when you find out a photo was edited in post because you're not getting to see a scene the exact way you'd see it if you were standing there, be glad that the photographer was able to tweak the raw data from the camera's sensor to match what s/he wanted to capture.",tdogg8,2015-03-12 06:50:00

"You know some of these answers are great! However they aren't really telling you much other then we have a probe with a camera since 2004. 

Did you ever wonder how we know what the Earth is made of? No really. We can't drill even 1/3rd through the crust of the Earth, the crust is thinner then the skin of an apple(If an apple was the size of the earth) and we can't get through that. Yet we KNOW what the Earth is made of. Not only that, we KNOW the Earth has a solid core made of iron.

Doesn't that just baffle your mind? Like how the fuck can we KNOW that.

Well many ways. We can build a model, and look for evidence that confirms the model.

We look at varying layers of rock, especially looking at stuff that used to be under the crust due to plate tectonics. This let's us know some of the composition of the Earth.

You know what's amazing though? Did you know you can tell if something is solid, liquid etc by sound? If an Earth Quake happens, if we know the strength it can literally ring the planet like a bell, sending a shock wave through the entire planet. This gives us a sound wave we can detect that tells us a lot of things. First Earthquakes aren't rare, so we get LOTS of data, we have good record keeping and timing so over a long time we could see the Earth has a solid plastic mantle, a solid iron core, and a liquid outer core. We then know the composition(Different percentages of elements) in the Earth and our data fits with models that show with our composition, size and density the Earth should of a solid iron core. We can demonstrate it!

What does this tell us about this moon though? Nothing I just wanted to tell you we don't need to ""see"" something to confirm it. In this case the probe orbiting it has instruments and cameras. Through those we can get data, and very clever people using the right models can infer and tell what's happening on a planet we aren't on if it can get enough data. We can look at the light and different colours can tell us exactly what elements are on the surface, we can get information on how things change on the planet indicating what's happening, hell we can even detect and see things being produced that can only be produced by X thing which fits the models perfectly.

We build a wall of evidence that fits the model and confirms the theory. We can do amazing things. It should blow your mind we know what the inside of the Earth looks like. Telling what's happening on the surface of this moon? Childs play if you can get a probe with the right instruments close enough.",Cizuz,2015-03-12 00:40:19

"Fire as we know it happens when a high concentration of a flammable substance sets off a chain reaction of oxidation.  Oxidation is when a substance combines with oxygen like from the ambient air.  Such a reaction releases a lot of heat energy.  The heat released by some of the material burning like this causes more nearby flammable material to oxidize as well.  And so on.  Heat released by burning causes more to burn, that's the ""chain"".

So much heat gets released in so short a time in such a chain reaction that the resultant oxidized gases ionize (atoms lose an electron, or have an electron excited to a higher quantum state by the heat) and then the atoms recombine with electrons again, releasing light, which we see as luminous flame.  These luminous ionized gases are also known as plasma.

Water itself does not burn, of course, because it is such a stable low energy molecule (the H's are already bonded with all the O's that they can handle).  

While flammable gasses and even oxygen can dissolve into water, water just can't carry enough of those gases for them to concentrate sufficiently to enable the chain reaction that we know as ""fire"".  

There have been accounts of ""water burning"" from a faucet near some fracking operations.  What's happening there is there is a lot of methane (natural gas) dissolved into the ground water.  When someone turns on the faucet, the water pours out, mixing with air bubbles and air in the room ... The methane releases from the water and can build up enough concentration near the sink that a fire can get set off.  The water itself is not burning.",AgentBif,2015-03-11 14:55:41

Get under the ice though, and that disappears. This is made trickier by all the radiation which happens on the way to Jupiter from the sun, as that alone can get above safe levels.

Io is much worse though, as it receives 3600 rem per day. If we want to send people to the Jovian system, they'll probably need to be based on Callisto, which only receives .1 rem per day, comparable to the surface of earth.

"Most evidence does indicate that Europa has liquid water under its crust, we just haven't confirmed it yet.  That being said, if both moons have liquid water, Europa is the one more likely to have life.  Enceladus hasn't had liquid water for as long of a time period as Europa (probably) has, and has a much smaller volume of water.  Enceladus has about as much water as Lake Superior, whereas Europa has more water than all Earth's oceans combined.

Here's a nice visualization of it:

How long has Europa had water? And how long has Enceladus had water?,ellipses1,2015-03-11 14:59:02
"Europa is a larger moon in a more stable orbit than Enceladus, so we're fairly certain that it's existed for longer.  There's also evidence that Enceladus goes through cycles of tectonic activity, and because of its lower mass and further distance from the sun, it's likely that Enceladus freezes over periodically.  Also, we can get a good idea of Enceladus's geological activity by looking at the mass in Saturn's E-ring.",virnovus,2015-03-11 15:16:00
"The reason I'm asking is that we kind of have an idea of how long until life started on earth... So if both moons have had water for that long or longer, then the length of time they've had water might not matter as much. If one has had water for 1.25 billion years and the other for 1 billion, both would have had plenty of time to develop life",ellipses1,2015-03-11 15:34:05
"One issue is that there's evidence that Enceladus goes through periods of freezing and thawing, whereas Europa is too large to go through these sorts of cycles.  So the total time that Enceladus has had liquid water over the course of its history is probably lower.

The other issue is that the chance of life forming via abiogenesis is a very low-probability event, but the larger the volume that it could occur in, the more likely it would occur eventually.

One reason that Enceladus is interesting is that it's a lot easier to sample its geysers in a flyby than it would be to send a mission to Europa, melt through its ice crust with a nuclear reactor, and then explore its subsurface oceans with a nuclear submarine. (or whatever extremely sophisticated probe would have to be developed)  But the main interest in Enceladus is in looking for evidence of panspermia.  That is, if there's any life on Enceladus, it's more likely to have been introduced from elsewhere, and if that life was introduced from Earth, or they shared a common ancestor, that would be extremely interesting scientifically.",virnovus,2015-03-11 15:47:15

"&gt; why this is true for some moons

Tidal forces (the gravitational squeezing effects) are caused by *changing* gravitational forces. There are two factors that determine how big this change is:

* the amount by which the distance between the moon and its planet varies over the moon's orbit, i.e. how non-circular its orbit is, a property known as eccentricity.
* how rapidly the gravitational field of the planet changes over distance, which is determined by the mass of the planet.

Enceladus' eccentricity is actually less than the Moon's, so the first effect can't explain the tidal heating.  
However, Saturn weighs about 100 times as much as the Earth, which means that the rate of change of its gravitational field strength is also 100 times greater. So Enceladus ends up experiencing a more than 100-fold greater variation in field strength (it's also closer to Saturn than the Moon is to us; the field strength changes more rapidly nearer the planet) and so it has more intense tidal heating.",nivlark,2015-03-11 16:48:04
"It's called tidal heating. 

Rotating in the gravity of Jupiter and/or saturn squeezes the planet back and forth as it rotates. As it squeezes the planet, it gets hot from the friction.  This keeps the inside warm enough to have liquid water. ",BigBennP,2015-03-11 14:19:29
"How does the conservation of energy figure in? I'm actually having a hard time grasping where does energy comes from? Is the moon slowing down its rotation because of it?

Edit: spelling",DoesRedditConfuseYou,2015-03-11 15:35:41
"Yes the tidal forces will slow down the rotation of the moon, this is what a tidally locked moon is. The lowest potential energy state of the moon and its rotation.

EDIT: Replaced planet with moon, although the moon also slows the rotation of the planet aswell.",altf3,2015-03-11 15:56:56
"In the case of the earth there is energy transfer from the rotation of the earth to the moon, there is total conservation of energy in the system but individually the earth slows its rotation and so does the moon, at this point the moon is locked (energy minima), so to compensate and maintain conservation of angular momentum (of the system) the moon gets slightly farther away as it gets heated by the squishing effect of tidal forces. 

We are actually in a unique period of time where the moon is the same angular size as the sun, and being just a hair smaller allows for very intense solar eclipses with the coronal ejections visible. In a few hundred million years the moon will be too far away for total eclipses, the energy to push it out comes from the slowing of the earths rotation, but the reason it recedes rather than just heat up and melt is a result of conservation of angular momentum.

To demonstrate the significance of this effect, even though the moon has been tidally locked to the earth for a significant portion of its existence (evidence by the large disparity in the number of craters between the ""day""/""dark"" sides). It has moved almost twice as far as it originally was and the earth's day has lengthened to almost twice as long as it was when life first appeared (evidenced by fossilized ancient coral growth rings shows day cycles as short as 12 hours in the early earth).

The effect on saturn from its moons will be much smaller due to the enormous size disparities, but the effect on the moons is amplified significantly, causing enough heat to maintain liquid oceans under the ice.",jakes_on_you,2015-03-11 16:58:33

"No, it is tidal forces.",kenshinmoe,2015-03-11 14:25:03

Basically, Saturn pulls Enceladus in one direction, and then the other moons in the system pull it in another.  This friction is a source of heat, deep inside the moon.",Prometheus0110,2015-03-11 15:52:39
"Actually, the most likely explanation is tidal forces. Enceladus is the same distance to Saturn's core as the Moon is to Earth, but Saturn is much more massive and thus exerts a stronger pull. Additionally, it has ""orbital resonance"" with another moon, Dione (essentially, they have an even ratio of orbits, Dione goes around once for each time Enceladus does twice). This helps create eccentricity in Enceladus's orbit, which leads to further tidal forces.

The tidal forces in turn pull unevenly on the matter that forms Enceladus. Since some of it is being pulled more strongly than the rest, this creates a lot of friction. This friction then expresses some of the tidal energy as heat, which in turn creates the relatively warm oceans.",Pegthaniel,2015-03-11 16:27:07

"Tidal forces from Saturn's gravity, made possible by the steep slope of the gravity well.  It's a heat generator that runs on gravity!",self-assembled,2015-03-11 14:32:42
"Yes it is theorized that the gravitational forces of Saturn are what is keeping this moon's core warm. Also when Saturn and the moon and the sun all line up (not to mention some of Saturn's other moons as well) that is when the most gravitational stress is put on the moon. This heats it through the process of friction. This is also what causes the volcanism on Jovian moons like Io.

These gravitational effects are just tidal forces, albeit very strong tidal forces. We do not feel the forces of tides here on earth. If we were on Enceladus, the only gravitational effects we would feel are that of the moon itself. The stresses of Saturn and the other moons gravities would not effect us. It is because the gravitational changes happen slowly and it is only because the moon you are on is so massive that the gravity has much more of an effect on it. 

Plus if there were gravitational changes and stresses that we could not handle on Enceladus, the life that would have evolved there would have evolved with that harsh state of gravity as it's norm. ",kenshinmoe,2015-03-11 14:22:22
"Just to clarify on tidal forces:

""Tidal forces"" are caused by a gradient in the gravitational field. The part of Enceladus that is closer to Saturn (facing it), for example, is pulled more strongly toward Saturn than the side facing away, and this is due to the fact that the magnitude of gravitational force decreases as a square of your distance from the object of interest. This difference in gravitational forces causes there to be an overall net force on the otherwise freely-falling body which 'squeezes' it.

This gravitational gradient is not steep enough to be felt by a human. Only objects that are sizeable - *not necessarily* massive, as u/kenshinmoe says - feel large tidal forces.

It is not outside of the realm of possibilities for a human to feel tidal forces in some place in the universe. Near small black holes, for instance, the gravitational gradient is so steep that you would be ripped apart ('spaghettified' is a commonly used term among black hole researchers and theorists) before you reached the event horizon. But, to follow the analogy, an ant may survive those forces to a closer radius due to its smaller size.",FunkePhresh,2015-03-11 16:29:42
"Well, the gravity of both Jupiter and Saturn is so immense that it actually tugs on their moons while they are orbiting the gas giants. The orbits of these moons aren't exactly circular, either, leading to tidal gravitational effects on the surface and interior of the moons. Basically, during a normal orbital period of the moons the gravity of Saturn tugs the material in the interior Enceladus, causing motions in the tidal bulges that heat the interior of the moon via friction. Think of it like squishing a giant racquetball in space. As you compress the ball the atoms are smashed closer together and as you release pressure they rebound back, resulting in atomic motion or more specifically, heat. Over a large enough scale this can melt water ice near the core of the moon and a thick ice exterior insulates the interior rather well. In short, gravity from Saturn stretches and compresses the interior of Enceladus which heats it up enough for liquid water to persist. The outer ice shell protects the water from evaporating into space and insulates it so the heat isn't precipitously lost, either. 

Water buoyancy is great for ameliorating gravitational stresses, too. Think of blue whales here on Earth. Their mass makes it difficult for them to expand their lungs out of the water because they are not buoyant in air, but in the ocean they do just fine. Any potential native life would be well adapted to life under the ice sheets of Enceladus. It wouldn't be a nice place for us, however (either massive doses of radiation on the space side of the ice or crushing pressures on the underside).

This is from my own cursory understanding, though. I'm a molecular biologist so I don't think I have a complete understanding of the underlying phenomenon. Anyone please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. I hope this helps.",the_walking_derp,2015-03-11 14:31:10
"[Enceladus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus) is geologically active, possibly because the pull from Saturn's gravity and other nearby moons squeezes it.",otatop,2015-03-11 14:19:07
"Like PsychoNariz said, molten/heated core. The reason why is a little different than Earth. The tidal force of Saturn is pulling on the moon, and some of the energy is converted into heat. Think of it like this--to soften clay up, you CAN boil it in water or microwave it. But you can also knead it with your hands. The motion/friction gives it heat. Another example of a moon that does this is Io: Jupiter pulls on it so much that Io has its own volcanic/tectonic system, complete with a bunch of eruptions and sulfur. It probably smells like ass. 

(On the other hand, Earth is molten because it is STILL cooling down from when it was formed.)",arydactl,2015-03-11 14:19:35
"This is sort of addressed in the article, but not really explained.  There's a couple different kinds of [Internal heating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_heating) but Enceladus is small enough and old enough that we think the majority of its heat is coming from [tidal heating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating).  The basic concept of tidal heating is that there's enough gravity pulling the planet in different directions (Saturn's always pulling it in one direction, and various larger moons pull it in other directions depending on where they are in their respective orbits) that the moon stretches and relaxes periodically, which causes enough friction to keep the core relatively warm.",xazarus,2015-03-11 14:33:20
"From what I understand, the ocean underneath Enceladus stays liquid because of something called tidal heating. This is basically where Enceladus is affected by Saturn in a way similar to our moon. Our moon creates tides and saturn does too. The constant movement of the oceans allow for enough heat for it to stay above 0Â°C. However,  because it is so far from the sun, and it has no significant atmosphere,  the surface does stay frozen at that distance. ",heavie1,2015-03-11 14:23:10
"The outer surface of Enceladus is ice because, as you said, it is very cold out near Saturn. The water is only liquid deep below the surface. This is because ice acts as an insulator on the outside of the moon preventing too much heat from escaping into space and Enceladus has a molten (or at least very hot) core. 

The core is hot because tidal forces due to Saturn and another moon called Dione which is in ""resonance"" with Enceladus are constantly flexing Enceladus back and forth. Resonance is when two objects have orbital periods that are a multiple of each other. Resonances can result in some funny gravitational behavior, one of which is increased tidal forces. This tidal flexing creates friction which creates heat.

We wouldn't be affected by the tides because tidal forces only affect things that are really big. For instance, you can't feel it when there is a high or low tide on earth but the force is large enough to move millions of tons of water several meters up or down.",goobuh-fish,2015-03-11 14:30:55
There is also the physics of water in play: water is at its maximum density at 4 degrees Celsius. A nice deep ocean like that can never freeze.,simcrook,2015-03-11 14:25:25
"Well shortbus It looks like the the warm water is caused by hydrothermal activity so it looks like the moon maybe has a molten core.

Other wise any warming of the moon would be caused by tidal forces. By that I mean Saturn is very slightly causing the moon to change shape as the moon spins. It changes shape because the side nearest a source of gravity (Saturn) will weigh slightly more the the side further away... because gravity. This very tiny changing of shape causes friction and heat.

This is how I understand it to be at least, there are some very smart people here that might have something to add if i'm wrong.

What if there is a nuclear reactor orbiting it and releasing heat? Or am I totally missing something.,petar_is_amazing,2015-03-11 16:06:28
"It was finally established a few hundred years ago that all bodies are actually orbiting the nuclear reactor. But at this distance, it doesn't do much good.

Nevertheless, you're right that a nuclear reactor is a good source of heat. But not for a whole small world like this. I'm no scientitian, but I expect that if the reactor was close enough to do any good, it's also close enough to do plenty of bad, too. The only reason we get away with orbiting the Sun as we do is that we have a robust atmosphere and magnetosphere to take the hard edge off. Enceladus has no such protection.

Nevertheless, assuming there's no life there and you're ready to do some terraformin', a sizeable reactor using the world ocean (or any body of water) for cooling could warm the place up some.

What you'll almost certainly never get to do, though, is traipse around on the surface like you could on the earth, and not just because of the comically low gravity. (Remember that a human only weighs about 1 kg on this world. The good news is that it's still big enough that you can't accidentally jump into orbit.) The world is not big enough to hold any kind of real atmosphere, and even if it could, you'd be subjected to radiation from all directions, without protection.

Nevertheless, you've got a good idea for how to make it more habitable, both under and possibly at the surface, though inside appropriate habitats. And I think your idea, if scaled up enough, could also warm the subsurface water to suitably meet human needs.

"Yay Panspermia!

Keep in mind that the signals we've sent out have barely been out there 100 years.  In the cosmic scale we haven't even reached the edge of our own back yard with those signals.

Even if we have reached another world we have to consider that the recipients may not have developed radio yet.

If they're on our level it may take another 100 years for them to get the ""Hello"" back to us again.

And/or they're so far ahead of us they're waiting for us to mature before they bother trying to talk to the meat flappers (us).



Yet another angle.   I read a [fascinating Panspermia paper](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/513781/moores-law-and-the-origin-of-life/) that examined the rate of increase of complexity on DNA.  It is an exponential value, with the number of *distinct* genes to doubling roughly every 376 million years.  Run the timeline backwards and it suggests the first DNA strands were created around 10 billion years ago to a simple enough molecule that it wasn't ""life"" at all.   They could have even formed in early nebula long before the cell wall was evolved.  If that's true then nearly every living thing we ever meet will almost certainly be from the same seed content and if it takes 10 billion years to reach where we are today there's a decent chance that no other aliens would have more than a few million year head start on us.

"Well,  a few things would happen. DNA analysis (if applicable) will tell us if we are related organisms. 

Related: If related, panspermia is now reality. The details would require more research--are we closer to the source, or are they? Do they have similar functions in regards to reproduction/sex/feeding? Do viruses plague them as well? Are viruses that are prevalent on earth present there? Do earth viruses affect them? Everything has its own implication.

Unrelated: Our solar system is confirmed as superhabitable, spawning TWO different kinds of life.  Searches for life will follow planets with hydrothermal vents--which are plentiful enough. 

Plenty of political implications: the presence of two independent sources of life implies that we are not alone. That means that everyone else in our galaxy is purposely quiet. Why are they quiet? 

A) intelligent life has a habit of killing themselves off before they reach the level of communication we have. 

B) we are not advanced enough to intercept intergalactic communications. They purposely do not initiate contact because we are primitive,  destructive,  and violent. 

C) Something has killed off all the intelligent life that made enough noise to be heard. These aliens hunt either for resources or for fun.  They do not negotiate,  they are out there,  and they wait quietly until they hear a noise ...

A is most likely.  We see it happening now.  The possibility of C will scare the shit out of every country on the planet. We will advance our weaponry not to defend against each other, but to defend against the unknown. Together,  Earth would learn how to whisper, instead of blasting radio into space.

"My honest opinion of finding microbiotic, very early level life on another body, in an ocean like this is that it will only matter politically for hundreds, thousands, millions of years.

Primarily, scientists will want to explore it. Funding it will become a debate for viability and popular opinion.

Political positions will be swayed and moved based on the over-all voting opinion of people in those countries who believe we should/shouldn't intervene.

A religious debate will open up among those voting peoples, contesting questions to the politicians running to determine their stance on the matter.

100 years from now, if it's decided to leave it alone, and collect small samples to study for scientists, it will be mostly forgotten. The debate will be between the higher learned, the scientists and politicians, to discover whether they can keep harvesting samples without creating conditions that would destroy the life present. If it's decided that we should ""do something"" about it, they would think of ways to affect it, and eventually people will forget.

However, what people won't ever forget, is the religious debate. Eventually, the religious debate will keep coming up, until eventually, ""Yeah but other life on other planets....."" will just become some random quip used. The same way we have, ""But the big bang..."" It's a quip that proves there's no religion for some, is disregarded by highly zealotous, and somewhere in between for everyone else.

Evolution would take thousands of years to even see a single mutation that's worth talking about in the scientific community. And even then, it will take a half a million years for a noteworthy difference from what we originally found for, ""Normal people,"" to care.

150 years ago, the dominant theory was that life ceased to exist beyond 550m (roughly 55 atmospheres of pressure, or 55 times the pressure you feel at the surface). Hydrothermal vents are teeming with life at 2500 meters (roughly 250 atmospheres of pressure) and reach 400 degrees C (750 degrees F).

This is necessary because if we count the Oort cloud, there are probably trillions of objects orbiting our Sun, but only a tiny minority of them of any appreciable size. Major planets must fulfil a number of criteria, such as clearing their orbital lane and maintaining a relatively stable orbit. There are eight of those. Smaller objects that are planetlike in appearance but don't meet all the criteria are dwarf planets. These include Pluto and Ceres and a number of Kuiper Belt objects.

Generally speaking, living *on* this particular world is not much different than living in space. There's no air, and it's brutally cold. But tidal forces heat the interior, allowing liquid water to exist, and it may have a very large subsurface ocean. So you could probably live *in* it, as long as you had a habitat to support you.

I'm still not clear on the science myself, but as best I believe I understand it, simple life is thought to be easy, but complex life is not. Assuming that transition occurred at some point at least a billion years ago, I think there could well be complex life there.

What form it would take, though, is anyone's guess. All organisms are obviously bound by the same natural laws, so things like flagella, legs, and such are more or less obvious, given a need and adequate resources. At the same time, there's no solar energy inside this world, the only place that anything could live. There is only thermal energy, and maybe some chemical energy available depending on what's there. So it would have to be very different from our own biosphere, which is mostly solar powered.

"""Sean Hsu, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder who helped to lead the team behind this new discovery, says the discovery happened in what was perhaps a counterintuitive way. He and his colleagues estimated the temperature, salinity, and approximate pH of Enceladus's ocean by studying the dust in Saturn's outermost ring. Really.

""We've known from quite early on that Enceladus was the source of the material in Saturn's [outermost] ringâ¦ based on the ring's composition"" Hsu says, ""although we didn't know the exact mechanism for the material transfer."" But the 2005 discovery of 125-mile-high icy geysers shouted out to scientists how Enceladus flung material skyward.""  

Hsu and his team analyzed a class of dust nanoparticles in this outermost ring. Using Cassini's mass spectrometer tool, they showed that these dust particles were made mostly of silica, and that they were the skeletons of evaporated geyser-flung saltwater. These particles point toward warm waters on Enceladus.

How? It turns out that the exact size range and makeup of the silicate particles gives the researchers a stunningly accurate blueprint of the conditions that forged them. For example, if Enceladus's ocean were really salty (say, over 4 percent, which is a bit more than Earth's oceans) then the silicate particles would have chemically clumped together, former bigger lumps than were found.

"Wow. This may also have large implications in functionally eradicating the most common type of HIV, the M-tropic version in ~90% of patients. Because you could reintroduce the patients own Hematopoetic (blood producing) cells which they mentioned, except with them being modified to have the CCR5 co-receptor deletion (Î32) which is needed for HIV to attach and replicate.
That's my 2 cents. I think it's worth a study though.

"Same statement, different connotation. The trouble with GF diets in non-celiacs is that you get no feedback to trace contaminations so adherence is difficult to impossible. The half life of those antibodies is months so even one slip up and you're back to square one. And that's not even taking into account that prevention and cure are often different beasts.",abletoma,2015-01-08 22:02:10
"I'm not sure how you can say an entire disease is gluten-mediated if you believe it impossible to collect data on the class of people with the disease who don't also have an autoimmune disorder related to gluten. It could be that some of these people react to gluten, but it's also quite likely that it's mediated by a variety of other causes. 

I'm not sure what ""cure"" would mean in this context anyway. You can't bring back damaged thyroid, so people would still be taking synthetics forever. Prevention of future damage would be the best one could hope for, I imagine.

I believe all of the ingredients they used were gluten free, but as is always the risk, there was some form of cross contact (utensils, frying pans, etc). This is my personal experience, and it has made casual visits with friends a lot more rare because of how I avoid eating out. Getting everyone together for a dinner at my place (and not letting them bring any food) takes a lot of effort and isn't nearly as easy as grabbing a burger and a beer.

"There have been some new developments with gene editing mainly a targeted gene modification system discovered in bacteria that they use as a defense mechanism. If you google CRISPR or CRISPR/cas9 you'll should get quite a few articles or google scholar for papers specifically. It's a pretty big breakthrough and allows basically for copy paste style editing. I don't know its error rate though. Much better than ZFN's I think but I haven't had a chance to work with either.

I think narrowing the scope of what parts of the immune system it targets is quite a ways off because this is pretty much nuking the immune system completely at this point. I don't know about allergies I suspect it would get rid of them but it would probably be too risky a treatment for most allergies. Targeted allergy relief will probably require  some fancy nanobots or something which aren't widely really that close to ready yet.

The important thing with those cases is they happened to find a match with an allele that prevents the HIV virus from entering the immune cells.

I asked how he supports himself financially. He said that since he moved to the US, he has been very poor and have struggled with housing. I believe he was homeless in San Francisco for a while.  Being the Berlin patient is a type of fame that informs his entire life. It's not like he walked away and led an everyday life.

The whole idea of the body attacking itself is just so insane.  I recently was diagnosed with RA.  The symptoms came out of nowhere, and hit me like a ton of bricks.  Did I eat a bad burrito??!!  haha,but seriously, what caused it?",ORD_to_SFO,2015-01-08 17:56:27
"Hard to say what caused it. Some of RA can be attributed to genetic predisposition, for example MHC genes and an enzyme expressed in T cells (Ptpn22), but there are other known and unknown factors.

MHC is a protein that is shaped like a hot dog bun and is the most variable family of proteins between different humans. The function of MHC is to ""show"" bits of viruses, bacteria, and other foreign proteins to T cells (we call these peptides, which are strings of amino acids) . These peptides are like the hot dog in the bun and T cells have proteins that recognize the combination of the hot dog and the bun. This recognitions triggers an immune response. The variants of the bun between different humans bind different peptides (one variant might bind peptide A but not B and another variant might bind B but not A). There are a few common variants associated with RA and it is hypothesized that these variants bind different peptides that contributes to RA.

""Hot dogs"" from your own proteins also bind to the buns, but your T cells are supposed be ignorant of these. First, T cells that are react too strongly to them are supposed to die, we call this negative selection, during their development in the thymus. Secondly, T cell activity is controlled by variety of enzymes. Some of these enzymes promote activity, while others limit activity. One type of enzyme is called a phosphatase and removes phosphate from an amino acid.  Ptpn22 found to be mutated in some patients with RA. Ptpn22 is involved in controlling T cell activity, but it is not yet known exactly how the mutations in this gene affect its function.  Ptpn22 is also associated with other autoimmune diseases including Type 1 diabetes.

Essentially, the simplest hypothesis for autoimmune disease is that a combination of factors affect which (or how or how much) peptides are in the hot dog bun and how your immune cells respond to this. From there it is unfortunately a snowball effect where each part can make the other worse.

There are definitely more possibilities, but I'm a bit out of the loop on RA associated genetics.",notofthetops,2015-01-08 21:03:25
"The short answer is that we don't really know what caused it.

The long answer is that out immune systems play probability games and that sometimes we lose. Our immune system has the awesome ability to identify and attack virtually any possible protein. Unfortunately this also means out immune systems have the ability to attack ourselves. We have several mechanisms to prevent this.

 Our first defense is the thymus. Before we let t-cells (adaptive immune cells) out to do their job, they have to pass a test. They go to the thymus where they are given all sorts of prices of our own proteins. If they decide to attack them those proteins, the cells are killed. At the same time, we only let cells out that at least show interest in the proteins. This ensures that only functioning cells make it out.

Our second defense is that t cells require two signals to attack. They require a protein that they recognize, but also some signs of stress or infection. 

What we think happens in autoimmune disease is that there is a sort of perfect storm. Maybe a person has been infected with a virus, so that cells that normally would not pass the second test now can. The wrong cell in the wrong place at the wrong time, but once that cell divides and picks up momentum, it is hard to stop because now it is causing enough stress to avoid the second defense.

The tricky part here is that that ""perfect storm"" hasn't really been observed. An infection seems like a reasonable first cause of autoimmunity, but no viruses have been shown to be conclusively related, so for all we really know, it could have just been a bad burrito.",kelny,2015-01-09 15:02:08

"Some strains of Staphylococcus make something called superantigens that trigger  activation of massive numbers of T cells (haywire, if you prefer). This is toxic shock syndrome AKA the warning on the tampons...

Also, saying ""thymus specifically is creating the haywire T-Cells"" is not really correct. We don't really know exactly how autoimmune disease is initiated, but it is likely that the balance of tolerance and available antigen is shifted. For example, even in average mice, auto immune disease can be triggered by increased the amount of self protein.  

It could be that the thymus fails to eliminate auto-reactive cells. Or, the patient has a MHC polymorphism that is related to different or altered presentation of peptides from proteins in the affected organ (like the pancreas in diabetes).",notofthetops,2015-01-08 15:40:14

"It is true that the thymus shrinks in size over the course of adult life, but output of new naive T cells continues (at a lower rate) as measured by detecting excision of genomic DNA during rearrangement of TCRa and TCRb loci (at least until age 85 from data I've seen).  Additionally, the residual thymus tissue (whether the canonical one) or other thymus-like tissue (Foxn1 dependent tissue generated in the neck area, for example) is capable of generating new T cells from transplanted donor hematopoietic cells after ablative chemotherapy or radiation.

The point is that the top comment here is talking about transplanting fibroblasts reprogrammed by overexpression of Foxn1, which is an experiment in mice, and has absolutely no bearing on the study linked by OP. In the linked study, progenitors from the transplanted autologous stem cells will migrate from the bone marrow to the remaining thymus tissue and differentiate into T cells.

"I took the comment by \u\Clinton_Kingsmouth to express that we can see a more broad use of the treatment mechanism and indeed perhaps a more severe 'resetting' in the future, if we don't risk sacrificing the extent of the immune system as we currently do.

I was under the impression that T cell generation as an adult was mostly limited to maintenance by already available T cells, so you couldn't really create new receptor diversity if you already lost too many, so chemo could create a sort of bottlenecking event.  I didn't realize that this was so naturally surmountable.",jagedlion,2015-01-08 21:09:55
"The thymus is like the DMV. It can't control what a T cell is going to do, but it allows some T cells that it thinks are OK to go out into the body and tries to get rid of those that are autoreactive (say outstanding DUI or reckless driving in the DMV analogy).

If the autoimmune disease was the result of failing to eliminate auto reactive T cells (as is the case with a disease called APECED), it remotely possible that you could engineer tissue that restores function.  If you were to transplant this tissue as they doing in the linked paper (under the kidney capsule), now we would have 2 DMVs. One that is more strict and one that is more lenient, but they don't communicate and can't control what the other is doing. Unfortunately, T cells don't have to renew their license so they don't go back and get checked again. There are some mechanisms to ""check"" T cells in the periphery, but they are not well understood.

I think the output of T cells from the thymus drops by about an order of magnitude every couple decades or so. Output at age 80 might be 1/1000th of that of a youth.",notofthetops,2015-01-08 21:30:17

Normally we would not recognice it as an invader since an immune response requires co-stimmulation, but let's say if randomly a bacteria was present then co-stimmulation would be expressed and we would now see the perfume as an invader.

"Gluten intolerance is celiac disease and is an autoimmune disease.

Lactose intolerance is not an allergy.",notofthetops,2015-01-08 16:18:00
"Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease, not a gluten intolerance (which has not been proven to exist, to the best of my knowledge). It is nothing like lactose intolerance. 

Lactose is a disaccharide. This means two sugars (molecules). An intolerance to lactose is based on how the small bowel is able to break down and digest these sugars. This is not an allergic or autoimmune response. It is not genetic. There's no lactose intolerance gene. It is broken down in the small bowel by an enzyme called lactase. This is an enzymatic deficiency,and considered relatively mild.

Gluten is completely different. It is a protein existing in certain grains (Wheat, rye, barley, oats.) It's not a sugar molecule. In coeliac disease, which is associated with certain genetic haplotypes, the response to gluten is *autoimmune*. The body responds to it as though it were poison, not a difficult-to-break-down sugar. One of the ways coeliac disease is diagnosed is through a biopsy after a ""gluten challenge"" to see whether there is any breakdown of the ""vilious architecture"", which is to say the lining of the small bowel. One of the reasons that coeliac disease can have drastic systemic consequences is because of this damage to the small bowel, which causes serious malabsorption.

Lactose intolerance will *never* do this. Disinformation about gluten in recent times is leading to a view of it as a *sensitivity* for many people (suddenly..) rather than an *allergy* for people with auto-immune disease (i.e. in hospitality industry *and* the community. 

Please don't say stuff about gluten in public forums if you do not know what it is; it can and does impact on people with medical illness. The more disinformation there is, the less understanding there is. People may overlook gluten in food served to coeliacs imagining it is just a matter of a slightly sensitive stomach and no big deal.

People *can* have difficulty digesting wheat products based on enzymes.

"[Coeliacs Disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease) is an autoimmune disease caused by genetic mutations

""There are seven HLA-DQ variants (DQ2 and DQ4âDQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate T lymphocytes and initiate the autoimmune process""",canoodle_me,2015-01-08 16:44:06

"And high saturated fats, low omega 3s is huge.

I can't find the full text but this is an overview of the study:

&gt;Beginning in 1949, he enrolled 150 MS patients and commenced them on his MS diet, a very low saturated fat diet.3 He followed them with meticulous examination and **recording of their dietary fat consumption for 34 years**. There was no control group who had normal diets, however many of the patients were unable to stick to the MS diet, allowing comparison between those that did and those that did not. There are also data on relapse rates in MS from many other studies. The study was supported by grants from the MS Society of Canada, the Montreal Neurological Institute, the Department of Health and Welfare of Canada, the MS Society of Portland and other grants. This was a major piece of medical research.

&gt;A number of papers resulted from this study, one in one of the worldâs premier medical journals, the Lancet in 1990,3 and another in Nutrition in 1991.4 The results provide enormous hope to people with MS.

&gt;The paper in the Lancet reported results for 144 patients. Of these, **72 patients were able to stick to the MS diet (good dieters)**, that is they consumed less than 20g/day of saturated fat. **The other 72 could not keep fat consumption below 20g/day**. The patientsâ neurological disability was graded using a neurological disability scale devised by Swank, which went from 0 (essentially unimpaired) to 6 (deceased). Point 4 on the scale represented wheelchair needed, and point 5 confined to bed and chair. Swankâs scale essentially used 2 points on Kurtzkeâs EDSS scale to every 1 point on his.

The results were dramatic. **Regardless of level of disability at entry to the trial, good dieters did not deteriorate significantly. Good dieters at level 1 on entry had an average final grade of 1.9 34 years later.** Good dieters at level 2 had a final level of 3.6, and those at level 3 or worse a final level of 4. The results were best for those **who started with minimum disability, with 95 per cent surviving and still physically active 34 years later,** excluding those who died from non-MS diseases. The benefits occurred in all three groups, and even people with significant disability were shown to markedly slow the progression of the disease if they could stick to the MS diet. The picture for poor dieters was terrible, in line with results from other series of MS patients whose conditions have been monitored over time. **Poor dieters with minimum disability at entry ended with average grade of 5.3, that is wheelchair and bed bound.** Those with moderate disability ended up at 5.3 also, and those with severe disability at 5.6. **Only 7 per cent of patients who did not stick to the MS diet remained active. The death rate amongst the poor dieters was extremely high.** 58 of the 72 were dead by 34 years, 45 from MS-related causes. The statistics were very strong. The p values were generally of the order of p&lt;0.0001 to &lt;0.0005 for most of the differences between good and poor dieters. That is, the difference was extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance.

Swank noted that patients who adhered to the diet for MS actually consumed 16g of saturated fat per day on average, whereas those who did not adhere to the diet for MS consumed 38g/day. Even for the âpoor dietersâ this was a marked reduction from the average 125g/day they were consuming prior to the study. It reinforces the message that the MS diet is an all or nothing issue. **Just lowering saturated fat consumption, even by two thirds as the poor dieters did, is not enough to make a difference to the progression of the disease. Saturated fat must really be completely avoided if possible.**

"Doctor that has performed this procedure (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) here. The chemo wipes out the bone marrow, after which a fluid containing blood stem cells, extracted from the patient before the procedure, is administered. These stem cells then repopulate the bone with young, fresh and especially ""naive"" white blood cells. These cells don't know what to attack and have to learn everything again. 

A common theory about MS is that it occurs in people who have a certain predisposition, that encounter a certain infection during their lives. This infection resembles the structure of brain cells (well, the myelin to be correct) causing the body to make antibodies against both. The infection disappears, and all that remains is their bodies attacking themselves.

This procedure is not without risks: I have never in my life given more anti-emetics and morphine than during a transplantation. Since these patients don't have an immune system during the transplantation, they're also very susceptible to (uncommon and dangerous) infections. That's why they go into isolation as long as their white blood cells haven't recovered. Even after that period, they still remain very fragile, as their immune system has been completely reset. All vaccinations must be re-administered and common infections can run a severe course in the first months after transplantation.

But, most often, such a transplantation is a life saver (or extender) for people with lymfoma, certain kinds of leukemia, multiple myeloma, germinative cancers, etc...

One thing they tell MS patients (new and old) is to stay active, both physically and mentally, in order to make the brain find/create new paths.  There are limits to what can be done (I have paresthesia in my right hand and no amount of therapy seems to take that away but I can do a lot to make it impact my usage of my right hand a lot less) but you can do a lot to both help your symptoms and prevent or minimize further attacks.

No: almost all cancer treatments (radiotherapy, chemo) have this risk. There are other kinds of chemotherapy that have an even higher chance for developing secondary malignancies.

"Before any type of treatment can be made widely available, it's efficacy and safety must be proved. This process occurs through the following phases and can take years or even decades:

* Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.

* Phase II: The drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

* Phase III: The drug or treatment is given to large groups of people to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.

* Phase IV: Studies are done after the drug or treatment has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. 

I'm not exactly sure what phase this trial was, but it is either I or II and although it looks promising the long term effects simply are not definitively known yet. This treatment is especially extreme, very expensive and taxing on the body. It would be highly irresponsible to start treating a large population of patients with something that has not been proven safe or effective yet. Like you mentioned, there is a high probability that this ""miracle cure"" doesn't pan out for whatever reason and if this is because of serious health side effects, you want to find that out before you give it to a bunch of people who are not in immediate life-threatening danger.

"Argh!!!  I've had this treatment.  Five years remission last November.  This is incredibly frustrating.  Something not widely known is this, the federal government covers the cost of Phase I and Phase II trials.   Phase III trials are usually paid for by pharmaceutical companies.  Let's put it this way....Tysabri was $20,000 a month as billed to my insurance company.  Most MS medications are $8,000-$20,000/month as billed to the insurance company.  A one time treatment that cost $40,000 ended up costing the pharmaceutical companies a great deal of money over time.  (This was at John Hopkins using cyclophosamide which is a chemotherapy that was patented in 1970).  NO PHARMACUETICAL company wanted to touch it,, at the end of the day they are a business.  If they can't make more money they aren't going to put in the money for research and development.  My insurance company is the reason I even received the treatment.  They were spending $60,000 every three months.  I was on Novantrone and plasma apheresis.  Additional therapies after treatment weren't allowed for six months.  (Other than life saving).  Therefore my insurance company ended up shelling out money on an experimental treatment to avoid the cost of $120,000.  They saved $80,000. The treatment I received lost funding in 2009 after completion of Phase II despite the fact that I was in remission.  This one sounds slightly better because they eradicate the immune system totally, mine they brought levels down to 0 before they started Nuepogen, stem cells were protected by a protein but the whole miracle cure thing is correct.  If they can reset the immune system it eradicates the disease.  I just keep Vit. D levels high.  That is my medicine, Vit D.  ",thethirdwife,2015-01-08 18:04:27

"Almost certainly, although the specific therapies may have to be changed depending on the exact nature of the disease. Autoimmunity occurs because the immune system's targeting mechanisms are failing to distinguish self from non-self for whatever reason. This does not happen instantaneously - these cells have to be ""educated"" against the affected tissue (in the case of MS, myelin sheaths). This part of the immune system includes a positive feedback loop, which means that the effect will be aggravated until the stimulus is gone. This works for normal pathogens - after all, you want your immune system to go all out when dealing with a virus or infectious bacterial species. However, the stimulus in the case of autoimmunity is the body itself, which means that the body will continually destroy itself.

But as I mentioned earlier, these cells are educated (or ""indoctrinated"" if you wish for a superior analogy) to attack the body's own cells by positive feedback signaling. There are naive populations of hematopoetic cells in your bone marrow (and other locations, but bone marrow is the best studied), but they too quickly become indoctrinated by the matured cells attacking the body. Thus, the solution is fairly simple. The naive cells are extracted from the patient and stored for later. All indoctrinated immune cells are destroyed via chemotherapy. The stored naive cells are transplanted back into the patient, where they are no longer primed for destroying the body's cells by errant immune cells, since those are all dead. Thus the immune system is repopulated.

The advantage of this therapy is that because it is autologous (same source), there is no need to find a matching donor and there is no risk of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). However, any therapy that kills off the entire immune system, however briefly, leaves the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infection. Additionally, because the ""old guard"" is gone, the immune system's memory may very well be gone with it if the memory cells have been killed, meaning that all the vaccinations and prior infections the patient had before chemotherapy may be rendered useless and re-vaccinating may be less efficient due to age or the stress endured by the body. Make no mistake: even though it uses rather advanced immunological and stem cell biological knowledge, this technique is a very blunt instrument. Research is being done to develop methods by which the immune memory can be preserved or replenished after therapy. ",onlymadethistoargue,2015-01-08 13:13:11
"&gt;Research is being done to develop methods by which the immune memory can be preserved or replenished after therapy.

This seems counter-intuitive since the entire point of the procedure is to remove the immune system's memory and wipe the slate clean.

"That's sort of what I'm saying. Our current treatment is very rough: it wipes out everything and starts fresh. Research on the immune system is ongoing, so if we can refine our techniques so that we can only disable or remove the autoreactive cells, we can also preserve memory of harmful pathogens. The other option is to find a way to quickly rebuild the memory of harmful pathogens, which is why I said future techniques would have immune memory preserved ""or replenished.""

"My sister had this procedure done when her stage 4, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma came back this year, and part of her treatment was chemo that destroyed her immune system.  From what I understand by what she reiterated to me from her oncologists is that this chemo treatment actually destroys bone marrow stem cells, which the sole purpose of these stem cells is to produce bone marrow.  Bone marrow of course, being the thing that allows for an immune system.

Before she started chemo, they gave her a drug that significantly increased her bone marrow stem cell production.  Then they essentially gave her a blood transfusion and filtered out these stem cells, since they are significantly larger than other cells.  They put them on ice and then she started chemo.  

When her chemo treatment was complete, they reintroduced her own stem cells back into her blood stream, and her body began producing bone marrow and white blood cells.  It's literally a new immune system.  

She has to get re-immunized for everything and for the first few weeks, her immune system was actually weaker than a new born baby's would be.  I jokingly implied that she should start eating her boogers.  Haha.

This procedure is fairly new I think, but it is absolutely incredible.  I'm also very happy to say that after chemo and radiation, she once again has no evidence of disease.

"The issue is that you have long-lived cells as well and if you don't get rid of those, the disease may stick around. For example, in MS these patients have T cells that react to proteins in the patients' brains and if you don't get rid of them all it won't matter that you have new stem cells--the T cells are still there.

"I notice that a lot of patients that are on the injectables and that are doing well on them, feel safer staying on them despite the weekly injections (or more frequently with the Copaxone), mainly because it has been on the market for such a long time with a relatively safe track record.

If you want to stay on the Avonex and prefer to cut the injections down from 4x a month to 2x a month, look into Plegridy (it was just approved recently) and have a discussion with your neurologist/MS specialist regarding it. It's just a pegelated version of the INF, and thus stays in the system longer, resulting in needing to inject yourself less. The safety profile is similar, so it should be an easy transition. 

Wishing you all the best on your fight to defeat MS!",bombina,2015-01-08 16:48:27
"Thanks bombina, I'll have to mention that to them. Thankfully, I just had a check up a few weeks ago so I don't have to go back and get another MRI for a whole year =). We talked about it, and the weekly injection really doesn't impact my life much or prevent me from doing anything I would like to do. I've never missed an injection either, so we've decided to just remain on the weekly injection. ",Todders077,2015-01-08 16:52:53
"Not a problem! I find that patients that are on the Avonex and that are stable on it, prefer to stay on it. Now with the approval of Plegridy patients are transferring to it once we mention it, to cut down the injections by half. 

On a unrelated note, do you get your MRIs done on a 1.5T or 3T magnet? The 3T MRIs produce really nice images and clarity. The machines are usually roomier, esp. good for pts. that are claustrophobic. Now, there is research being done even on 7T magnets.

"Have you found another alternative treatment that has helped control your relapses? The newer oral therapies are stronger in preventing relapses, disability progression, etc -- but have an increased side effect profile. I noticed that overall, out of the (3) oral therapies available, Tecfidera seems to have the most complaints with the GI symptoms, skin rashes, or the LFTs shooting up and pts. that qualify for the Gilenya or Aubagio tend to do relatively well without too many complaints (very low % of pts. complain of the transient hair thinning which resolves within the year). 

If you are young and have a fast disease progression, maybe you would be a candidate for Tysabri (1 monthly IV injection at a clinic that has the capacity to do it).

"I have MS. My doctor (who is one of the top neurologists for MS in the country) starts almost all patients out on one of the interferons or copaxone.

Copaxone doesn't even have any symptoms really, except for pain at the injection site. 

Gilenya can cause your heart rate to drop dangerously-- the first time you take it, you have to stay in the doc's office for six hours and get EKGs once an hour. I know they're trying to develop a safer version that doesn't have these side effects but that's a ways off.

I only wanted to say that, same as with MS itself (it can affect you greatly, or very little), the side effects that the avonex or other MS meds cause you can, and will, vary greatly from patient to patient. I was afraid of them before I got my first shot, but in fact I don't even have to take ibuprofen or paracetamol or anything else to avoid flu-like symptoms, because I don't experience any 9 of 10 times.

"My father had a version of this procedure done around 1997 in Seattle (I believe the researchers were with UW) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to treat his Chronic-Progressive MS. They harvested stem cells from his bone marrow and then gave him high does chemo before reintroducing the stem cells back into his blood stream. A stem-cell transplant, and as far as I can tell from the article, it is the exact same procedure described here.

The process was very arduous due to chemo sickness, and since the patients were housed nearby each other we learned that several of the patients died as a result of complications from being immuno-suppressed (they got infections). As described in the article, insurance refused any coverage and my parents paid $145k out of pocket to try to save my dad from MS.

Now, I don't want to discourage anyone with MS, like many others I am hopeful that someday MS can be completely cured. In my father's case, after initially appearing to have had a halt in new symptoms and plaque sites, after several years his disease returned and progressed, eventually leaving him functionally a quadriplegic. He died in 2009 (12 years or so post procedure) from Leukemia that may have been brought on by the chemo treatments he received. In general, for a man with Chronic-Progressive MS, he lived longer than average with his diagnosis, but the stem-cell transplant did not cure him.

My point in relating this personal (and anecdotal story) is just to say that this procedure has been around at least a decade before this study, Also, this is a small study and over a short period of time. Hopefully with more research it can lead to an actual cure for MS, but don't forget, much more work probably needs to go into it for that to become a reality.

"Hi guys. I'm a second year medical student who has some prior experience with some of this stuff. I'm by no means an expert, but I'd love to lay some things out there for anyone who is interested!

**How/why Does This Work:**
Very briefly, there is a portion of your immune system that is termed the ""adaptive immune system."" It is called this because it responds (""adapts"") to infectious invaders in a way unique to each invader. For example, certain types defenses would be better to develop and use against a strep throat infection (IgA antibodies for the curious) vs others that would be better to use against a leprosy infection (CD8 cell-mediated cytotoxicity for the curious).
Your adaptive immune system is the part of the immune system that orchestrates a unique response to each different foreign invader your body encounters, and very importantly, **it remembers how it responded**. By remembering how it responded to a certain invader in the past, the adaptive immune system makes sure to keep that type of response in ""stockpile"" so that if your body ever encounters that same invader again, your body can fight back really strongly from the get go. **This is why you generally don't get infected with the same pathogen more than once,** with some exceptions of course. This is also how vaccinations prevent/lower the intensity of future infection.

*Why does this matter for autoimmune diseases like MS?*
The theory is that in autoimmune diseases, your adaptive immune system, for whatever reason, has developed a specific weapon against one of your normal tissues in your own body. Your adaptive immune system ""thinks"" it has a constant infection on its hands, and is trying to eliminate it. So really, your adaptive immune system has made a huge mistake and the patient has to deal with a terrible disease.  

*Why does your adaptive immune system develop an immune response against your own tissue in the first place?*
There are several theories for this, but suffice to say that **something at some point in time pushed your adaptive immune system into an error in which it targets your own tissues. Because the adaptive immune system always remembers what it has targetted in the past, from the point of the error onwards, it will always recognize the targetted tissue as an enemy to destroy**

*The effect of chemo and bone marrow transplant (BMT)*
Basically, chemo drugs are used to **destroy the entirety of your immune system. This means that all ""memory"" of past infections and ""stockpiles"" of weapons uniquely crafted for each invader are destroyed because the cells that functioned as this memory/stockpile are destroyed.** This means that any ""memory"" your adaptive immune system had about targeting your tissues as an enemy is also gone! **So, just like many of you have aptly said, this can be conceptualized as an analogy of restarting your computer when its acting funky.** Now, this obviously has its own host of risks and things. For example, any ""memory"" of vaccinations or past infections has also been erased, so you need to completely re-immunize these patients. Additionally, during the process of the chemoablation therapy and subsequent BMT, the physician has basically made the patient have a non-existent immune system, which is for obvious reasons a very risky thing to do. **However, as many of these autoimmune diseases are so debilitating, many patients consider the risks to be well worth the potential rewards.**

**Others Using this Therapy to Great Success:**
Similar to Dr. Nash in this article, Dr. Burt at Northwestern University's Division of Immunotherapy for Autoimmune Diseases (DIAD) in Chicago has made some really exciting progress in this field, and has treated patients of many different autoimmune diseases with this therapy.
Some of the diseases being treated with this research: **MS, Crohn's Disease, Scleroderma, Lupus (SLE), Diabetes Mellitus Type I.** Website for the interested:

**Patient Perspective Success Stories:**
http://www.stemcell-immunotherapy.org/pub_vid_edwin.html

Hope this was at all helpful to anyone who is curious about this stuff. Sorry that I was not ""very brief"" as I Initially stated I would be.

**Edit for readers with MS or with loved ones with MS:** Dr. Richard Burt of DIAD at Northwestern University is currently performing a large scale Randomized Control Trial with this sort of procedure as a treatment for MS. I think is about 70% complete and the team is looking for more patients. Please look into it if you think you may at all be interested.

Thanks for putting it in such clear terms. I have one question though. You said that the chemo destroys the entirety of your immune system and all those 'memories' of past infections are gone. So does that mean that patients that go through chemo essentially have to get all their vaccines again? I'm referring to the vaccines you're supposed to get growing up or any that you may have had prior to the chemo.,actualtext,2015-01-08 20:11:57
"Yes, that is exactly what happens and your reasoning is correct.

However, keep in mind that there are many different levels/regimens of chemo. The chemo we are talking about in this therapy is at really really strong and toxic levels because it is specifically designed to leave no immune cell survivors. Not all chemotherapy being given to many cancer patients, for example, is at such high levels (though it can be--e.g. BMT for leukemia patients).

Is there more of you or the cancer?  If the disease is well localized then treatment methods can be selected that target the specific area with less collateral damage to the rest of the body and organ systems. Remission is just the ability/or inability of the diagnostic markers/methods to detect any further signs of the disease. 

Leaps and bounds have been made in detection and management both of MS and cancers.

"My limited understanding is that this sort of thing has been proposed to combat cancer and aging as well, by folks like Aubrey De Grey. Can anyone more knowledgable comment?

The gist from what I've heard is that cancers and age-related diseases are a result of cells mulitiplying incorrectly (including stem cells?). So a proposed solution would be to periodically nuke all the adult stem cells in the body and resupply them from an external stock (like something banked from childhood, or produced with biotech from pluripotent embryonic stem cells or something along those lines). That way, the body's processes for repairing itself using adult stem cells won't deteriorate as much over time.

Also you feel like total shit when they're giving the heavy chemo needed to nuke your immune system and it will likely leave you prone to various cancers in the future because of how chemotherapeutic agents work.

Diagnosed with MS about two years ago. This sounds awesome. And a bit scary.,GatoNanashi,2015-01-09 05:46:45
"They took out nascent immune cells (blood stem cells) before they wiped out the patients' immune system.  This means that the nascent immune cells would still carry the defect that caused them to target the myelin resulting in MS.  Thus, when they put these cells back into the patients (after their immune system is wiped out) the **defective immune system would be reestablished and the patients would still have MS, right?  Apparently not because the MS improved significantly. So what is going on here?**  


Well I looked into it a bit and the last paragraph in the Discussion section of the research article (http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2084840) indicates:


&gt; In the early months after [administration of nascent immune cells], MS remissions are likely achieved as a result of [low number of immune cells]. However, we speculated that long-term remission may result from persistent immunomodulatory [i.e. immune-modifying] effects of [high-dose immunosuppressive therapy/transplant of nascent immune cells].


Now I take this to mean that improvement in disease severity in the early months after the therapy is likely due to the fact that the body no longer has the defective autoimmune cells because the entire immune system was killed off.  But the question still remains...how does the therapy result in long-term remission given that the defective immune cells are reintroduced into the patients?


The paragraph continues:

&gt; 
&gt; ...CD4+ **memory** T cells have **not** recovered to baseline levels in peripheral blood even at 2 years **after** transplant...For CD4+ T cells, dominant T-cell receptor clones present **before** treatment were **not** detectable following reconstitution, and patients usually developed a **new** repertoire consistent with an immune reset. In contrast, the CD8 [cytotoxic protein component of T cells] repertoire reconstituted largely from clonal expansion of cells that were present **before** treatment.


To me, this means that 

(1) the memory cells that would have reminded the immune system to attack myelin did not recover to normal levels, 

(2) the few memory cells that were present didn't have the same cell surface protein receptors (presumably the same ones that target myelin) as before the therapy, and 

(3) that the reconstituted immune system still had the same capacity to attack (whatever it deemed to be foreign) because the CD8 of the reconstituted T cells was the same type as before the therapy.  

Collectively, this **implies** that the therapy changed the memory T cells such that they no longer directed the immune system to target myelin.  

Okay so this is getting closer to the answer, but the question of how (molecularly) the nascent immune cells differentiate into a mature immune system that no longer targets myelin (or at least no longer induces autoimmune-mediated MS) is still unclear and largely unaddressed by the article.  Am I understanding all this correctly?  Would someone with immunology and or MS knowledge chime in please?",treklamer,2015-01-09 10:44:08
"I have Relapse/Remit MS. Although it still sucks, my medication appears to have slowed it down.

Typically they will only accept patients who are having frequent steroid treated relapses who aren't responding to other drug therapies. Progressive patients can be treated but only at certain hospitals globally (one in Tel Aviv and one in Moscow for now). PPMS also doesn't have the same success rate as RRMS.

If Dr Burt thinks he can help you and offers his treatment, his people contact the insurance company on your behalf and majority of the time they get the procedure covered.

Could you explain your post a bit more? What is Borrelia and spirochete? A quick Google says bacteria, but I don't really know.

"Borrelia burgdorferi is a type of spirochete. It is the one you will find in everyone with Lyme. The problem is, it can cause more than one problem. It's been found in people who have what's been termed ""auto immune disorders"". It's incredibly sneaky; it's like a corkscrew and can bore through every part of the body; can appear in more than one form; can go dormant for decades behind a biofilm cyst where it becomes unreachable by any antibiotic known to man. 
If antibiotics had hit it quickly before the formation of biofilms, yes - it could have been killed. But once biofilms are in place the only way to reach these spirochetes would be to destroy the biofilm. 

Some of the diseases that are being linked to this bacteria by finally detecting its presence: Alzheimer's, MS, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Parkinsons.

One of the foremost bacteriologist/virologists in the world stated her opinion that 90% of the US population has been infected. But of course - this can go dormant in hiding, remaining undetectable for quite a long time. 

There are only about 5 labs in the country capable of detecting spirochetes once they've gone into ""hiding"", and it can take a long time and upwards of $20,000 to do it. Insurers won't go for that, so this is a cash proposition.",Rubieroo,2015-01-08 20:45:02

There are many theories as to what the cause of MS may be and treating it through chemo doesnt take into consideration all the unrelated, genetic flaws in MS patients such as the weird coincidence that over 95% of all MS patients have narrowed jugular and azygos veins.

I'm also not to thrilled with the fact that they seem to quote this treatment as a miracle when in reality a lot of the people who took this medication (mitoxantrone) suffer from permanent heart damage after as little as two treatments, people like my own father for example. Not only that but the man was deteriorated, going from forearm crutches, to a wheelchair over the course of that time and when we stopped treatment he was back on his feet and walking within a year (he also attempted a new treatment which imo was a success).",Thallkenbrack,2015-01-08 14:31:02

Conversely, if the individual who brought in the disease brought it to an area that has a high population of vaccinated folks, nobody else gets sick, and the disease is contained.

I think our difference of opinion here is I'm thinking at a much larger scale whereas you're thinking of if someone was in the same room. In which case, that's not what herd immunity is talking about. At least, not in the case of a highly contagious illness like measles.

Unless they want to spend the rest of their lives in a clean room with no contact to another living thing, they must rely on the people around them in order to function normally in day to day life.

"Natural immunity and vaccine immunity work the same way. The vaccine triggers an immune response to weakened version of the contagion. So, it's not strong enough to see effects (although, in the case of the chicken pox vaccine, some do see a *mild* case of it, with 2 to 5 spots), but it's strong enough to trigger your immune system to target it and store antibodies. So, for most diseases, there isn't too much of a difference between the two. As far as chicken pox goes, I'm not 100% certain. I'm by no means an expert in this field, but IIRC, the chicken pox virus doesn't actually ""go away."" The body's immune system is able to suppress it into a dormant state, but it's still there. Whether the vaccine does this as well, I'm not sure. I would assume that, because it's still there though, the body would still be creating antibodies to keep it suppressed, so it's possible that a ""natural immunity"" could be more long lasting simply because it doesn't actually ever get rid of the virus. But again, not an expert, the vaccine could trigger the same sort of thing.",Gnomish8,2015-02-18 10:03:51

The diligence required to prevent infection is something that has to be learned through repeated trainings, over time. Hospitals were doing it in single sessions.

It wouldn't be a fool-proof process (not by a long shot, depending on the severity of the infection in-and-of-itself) but it allows the body the ability to generate new cells that are protected against infection, and denies the virus the ability to use those cells to keep on growing in the body...",MagusUnion,2015-02-18 08:29:14
"Unfortunately, this [article](http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v9/n5/full/nrmicro2564.html) would suggest that's not a viable option. (Stem cells don't ""die off"")

Irradiation (to kill HSCs), coupled with HAART, coupled with bone marrow transplant from a healthy donor, coupled with this therapy could potentially work. There was a man cured of HIV because he recieved a bone marrow transplant from a donor who was immune to HIV. This therapy could be used in a similar way without needing an HIV immune donor.",thisdude415,2015-02-18 08:39:39
"Ah yes, the Berlin Patient. /u/MagusUnion basically addressed what I was getting at in my comment. My understanding was that early thymocytes are CD4- until fairly late in the differentiation process. But I had no idea thymocytes even laid latent until you posted that article.

So that does throw a wrench in things. You'd have to sum the duration of latency with the lifespan of an infected cell. You'd really need protection rates pretty much at 100% for it to work, including good thymus penetration, and then it'd be injections every thirty or so weeks until that summed duration had passed. I'm pretty sure that's how Harvoni cures Hep C (admittedly simpler not being a retrovirus), provide such comprehensive protection that after waiting it out for 12 weeks the thing is dead.

Might something similar work for HIV on a longer scale? 

Still, I don't think it would need to include bone marrow, as CD4+ doesn't occur until the thymus. Anyhow, I function pretty exclusively at the clinical level nowadays, so I'm probably missing all sorts of caveats that a microbiologist such as yourself would pick up on.",footprintx,2015-02-20 00:07:13

"This is exactly why we don't have a cure for HIV infection. HIV establishes a reservoir very quickly (48 hours) in memory Tcells. These cells stay latent for a long time with HIV dna integrated in them. 

Current antiviral drugs already zap any HIV that dares to start replicating but can't do anything to those infected sleeping Tcells, where HIV is just integrated somewhere into the DNA of the cell and it's merely inactivated genetic information. This presented therapy would not change this at all, other than you would not have to take a pill every day, but rather something more long term to achieve viral supression.

The key to curing someone of HIV would be to flush those reservoirs. There's a lot of research going on in that area but nothing too promising so far. Seems like functional cures or prevention methods will be here sooner than anything else.

"When you become infected with HIV, your body already does produce antibodies against it, so that wouldn't really do much. That's why people get a transitory flu-like illness, and then become better, they develop antibodies that keep the virus in check for a while; that's what stops it from progressing straight to AIDS. The problem is that HIV integrates into people's DNA, essentially sticking it there permanently, and the body can't clear the virus completely. Because the virus isn't fully eradicated, it can slowly infect more and more cells until it overwhelms the immune system, despite the antibodies that are present.

There's also an issue that it's really hard to make antibodies to HIV, because the outer part of HIV is highly variable and is really prone to mutations, so it's hard to develop a vaccine that will cover all variations of HIV. It's like why we have to get a flu shot every year, except the problem is even worse.

"One problem I see is that this is mainly to stop the virus from infecting any more cells. Already infected cells will of course stay infected. The monkeys were only saved because they have been genetically modified to express the molecule themselves, you can't do that with humans.
Also I am not sure about how fast the virus may adapt in mutations to this drug. It could be that this drug attached itself outside of the hotspots of viral mutation, but it still might lead to a slow selection of HIV variants that bind this less likely.

edit: just to avoid more people telling me, I have been told numerous time that the researchers actually used an AAV system to make the monkeys express their engineered molecule, which is also a possible strategy for human treatment, but also still in the early stages due to complications in some studies. also super expensive still.",OldManLaughingBull,2015-02-18 05:12:27
"&gt; you can't do that with humans.

...yes you can. These monkeys were injected with adeno-associated virus (aav) into their muscles to express this antibody. AAV is a non-pathogenic virus that when designed as a delivery vector has a much reduced chance to integrate (wild type aav has a site specific integration point at chromosome 19, I believe, it's early). Although gene therapy treatment is still massively lagging behind mass acceptance, due to the death of Jesse gelsinger because a mistake by researchers, and issues with leukemic development in ADA-SCID patients, this treatment is totally viable. The issue would be, first cost. The one accepted AAV drug on the market, glybera, only licensed in the EU, costs $1.6 million for a one time dose.

Now, cost aside, the other issue is that HIV can use two Co-receptors for integration - ccr5 and cxcr4. Now, I've seen that ~50% off AIDS patients are ccr5 tropic, but if the virus mutated it could use the cxcr4 receptors. Blocking this receptor is more difficult since it is integral for hematopoetic stem cells. Also, this treatment only targets circulating virus, but latently infected cells, such as hematopoetic stem cells that aren't cycling wouldn't produce the virus and you would still have long-lived cells in your body. So this would serve as a functional cure, but not a sterilizing cure.

So, this idea is a good approach although it does have potential limitations.

"At this point it's still largely in academia... Universities do the groundwork and start phase I trials; usually phase I success means they'll look for corporate partnerships with big pharma. I'm sure there are some small biotech companies doing gene therapy too, but I don't know any off the top of my head.

In terms of big centers for gene therapy in the US, UPenn is the big one. I go here, so I'm biased, but it is home to Jim Wilson (the leader of the study that killed Jesse Gelsinger; he obviously screwed up there but still does great basic science), Jean Bennett (developed AAV therapy for a rare form of blindness; likely to be the first gene therapy to be FDA approved in the USA); Carl June (chimeric antigen receptors, gene therapy for leukemia), Kathy High (AAV for hemophilia B) - all of whom have made pretty astonishing progress in the field. Penn has also partnered with pharma company Novartis to further develop the CAR T cell technology for cancer therapy.

I'm obviously not as knowledgeable on other places, but off the top of my head, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Washington (Fred Hutch), and Memorial Sloan Kettering are the big ones.

That said, mass-producing AAV vector is not easy. It takes my lab about 2 weeks to make and quantify enough vector to give a low dose to 3kg of animals. Each vector prep efficiency varies dramatically as well, so sometimes it takes multiple preps just to treat a small animal. A lot of the work could probably be mechanized to make mass production possible, but the disposable materials going into the preps would still keep the price up to the thousands, especially since human vectors can't be made using any animal products.

AAV also takes a lot of physical space to grow in cell monolayers, so you would need a pretty huge facility to produce large quantities, and it would all have to be totally sterile or your cells die and the preps are no good.",fallenstard,2015-02-18 11:36:39

So what would happen if you were to design a gene that lead to the production of protein that expressed numerous receptors of both ccr5 and cxc4 and was secreted so that it functionally acted as an HIV sponge circulating in the blood that bound whatever HIV viruses were around and then was peed out?  Would this work? Would this cause interference with normal functioning of cells? ,101312,2015-02-18 12:11:34
"In an ideal world that would work. The problem is that the CXCR4 receptor is critical for the binding of CXCL12. Why is this important? Well, the hematopoietic stem cells that produce all of your blood cells relies on this signaling pathway. [In mice with a complete knockout of CXCR4 there was a severe reduction in HSCs and ""increased sensitivity to myelotoxic injury"".](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761306005152). So, we clearly cannot knockout both the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors from the cells.

In terms of an antibody that expressed CXCR5 and CCR5 it is likely that the highly vascularized bone marrow, which has endothelial cells expressing CXCL12 would likely have a reduced capacity to signal with the HSCs, increasing the likelihood of a poor bone marrow niche. Since the CXCR4-CXCL12 pathway is integral in helping infused HSCs, such as during a bone marrow transplant, reach the bone marrow niche I would assume that such a disruption would lead to a release of HSCs from the bone marrow and likely a higher turn-over of cells.",turtle_flu,2015-02-18 12:32:41
"I see, thank you.  My knee-jerk reaction is to ask if we could program the HIV virus to express affinity for a third garbage receptor that we would simultaneously then have expressed by antibodies via the aforementioned mechanism, but I fear that a) not as easy to alter HIV DNA and b) you're creating selective pressure to select for the original 2 receptors, so only a matter of time before the virus mutates away from the dummy receptor. 

I'm glad people smarter than me are working on this. ",101312,2015-02-18 12:44:39
"I read that AAV has major limitations in humans. One reason is that patients might have already been exposed to AAV and developed immunity before the gene therapy.

A large majority of the populating had antibodies against aav serotype 2 (there are 11 human serotypes currently known). Through capsid engineering we can limit the viral reaction, and by mixing parts of capsids we can develop better ones. Now, the other thing is that aav for gene therapy has a very low frequency to integrate into the genome. This is good on that it is much less likely to disrupt genes that need strict control to prevent cancer. What it means though is that if a treated cell divides the genes delivered get diluted out.

Will only the rich have access to these breakthroughs? ",fittitthroway,2015-02-18 09:20:41
"Gene therapy is very much a growing field, especially for congenital genetic defects. A large interest is in acquired immunodeficencies, as well as inborn errors of metabolism. With that said, with the understanding of reprogramming of cells, there is interest in developing gene therapy treatments for type 1 diabetics, hemophiliacs, etc. The field was really hampered by some of the early poor results with oncogene activation, but as our understanding has progressed we are able to make safer and better viral vectors for delivering the genes of interest. Ideally it would be a way of the future, allowing for your genetic defect to be cured (although since it would not correct your germline cells the mutations would still be passed on to your offspring). 

Right now, the rich only have access to this. That said, once more hurdles with regulatory agencies are overcome and the practice is more widely accepted I believe that the cost will drop to a much more reasonable level. When will this happen?

A researcher from University of Washington lectured on the use of small gas bubbles injected with plasmid DNA (circular DNA) that could be delivered to hepatocytes by ultrasound.

"&gt;This only works for certain things.

Absolutely.  You would need a really strong systemic virus to even come close, and even then if the change bestowed an adaptive disadvantage, the non-modified cells would be more likely to parent replacement cells over time.  This would basically never be an option until entirely unimagined methods are developed.

If you need to supress a certain cell process that is specific to a particular physcial location (say, a given protein's prduction in the lungs to prevent a chronic, genetic breathing disorder) you could probably accomplish that farily well with an inhaler.  Not so much for blood chemistry.

"Yes, but depends on the virus. You see, HIV is a retrovirus that is able to integrate into the genome of your cells. From there it can be replicated essentially indefinitely, if the virus doesn't strain the cell too much or if the immune system doesn't find out about it (both complex mechanisms). This also means, once these cells divide, the genome of the virus integrated into your cells genome will also be copied into the new cell, which is then ""infected"" right from the start. So in order to really get rid of the virus you'd have to eliminate all cells ever infected with it. Which is actually not really necessary, as long as only few cells are infected and your immune system can handle the resulting virus production. But still not an optimal situation, because every now and then your immune system might get compromised and weakened, and then an infection like this might fire up again to a point where your immune system can't help you anymore.

For other viruses that don't integrate into the cells genome it is much simpler. Vaccines work very well for that, because the particles can be recognized from the start by the immune system. Basically gives your immune system a better start to fight the infection. Even if they infect a cell, they won't be able to keep production up indefinitely and more important they will never get to be copied into a new cell after cell division.",OldManLaughingBull,2015-02-18 06:25:09

If everything works out etc. it theoretically works out fine.

I'm not sure why you're stuck on the expense. Current ARV medications run around 2-3K a month. Most people have insurance or are covered by ADAP though so it's a non issue.

There are already gene therapies out there where a patient gets infected with whatever gene they are lacking. We definitely know how to introduce genes into mature animals and humans. That is what they did with the monkeys after all. They injected the virus with the antibody gene into the muscle. I have heard that infecting animals with genes is even easier if you use an HIV shell as a vector because they easily infect.,xam2y,2015-02-18 06:33:36
"Hummm, i think you misunderstood the concept of genetically modified monkeys. They werent actually modified but injected with a self replicant harmless virus that has in its genetic code the schematic for the artificial antibody. And those virus are meant to replicate over and over and over again, just like AIDS. Aka, producing the antibody from inside you. So the vector virus is actually the genetically modified thing.

Now, even a patient already infected by HIV would benefit from such a tool. Why ? because HIV is also a self replicant virus that uses our own defensive cells as a benchwork to replicate itself and then blowing it up to dissmeniate its newly created HIV cells. SO in the end, what kills you and actually turns into AIDS it the fact that HIV has destroyed too many of your defensive (T4) cells.

Adding to already HIV+ patient that artificial antibody would equal to add a competition to our own T4 cells. From what i understand, the artificial Antibody is made so it is more attractive to HIV so in the end, even for HIV+ patients, it would allow a massive slow down, or even regression of the illness. As our body is constantly producing T4 cells, if somethign is there to prevent HIV from targetting them all the time, pretty much acting as a bait, then you'd see patients go back to perfectly normal T4 cell levels. Which would pretty much mean not being sick at all. Yes you'd still be contagious (and even that remains to be seen) and there are many kinks to rule out, and many testings to be done, but overall it's a very possible solution.

It doesnt kill the virus out of your body. it just traps it. And you can use it at any age as the genetically modified part of it is actually the inoffensive virus that will function in you as a printing machine for the artificial antibody.

There's a huge difference in the R&amp;D pipeline, the effectiveness and the ability to work around/affect resistance.  If Truvada is the pinnacle of what a small molecule can do, and CD4-IG is the simplest of what synthetic biology can achieve - and it already outperforms - then we're in for some interesting times.

A new protein can be 'designed' and then produce in a matter of days/weeks which is just not the case with these complex small molecules like Truvada.  Further, the protein is a mimic of your own body rather than a target for HIV, so when the HIV mutates resistance to the drug - in the case of the protein, it will also mutate away its own virulance.

---

The tl;dr answer to your question is yes. In detail, the researchers did not attempt to vaccinate the Rhesus macaques against HIV-1 infection as usual. Here, they used a (non-HIV) viral vector to get the monkeys' bodies to start making a specific protein (the eCD4-Ig). IOW that protein was not a natural immune response - it was put there with intent. Once the animals were producing the protein, the researchers attempted to infect ('challenged') the animals with live HIV virus (a variant anyways) to see if the eCD4-Ig developed by their immune systems prevented infection. And it did!

The next logical question I suppose would be, why don't we start doing this with all people immediately? It's not really my area but essentially gene therapy which is very tricky. It's inefficient, unpredictable, and has several potentially fatal errors that can happen (like if your immune system reacts very badly to the vector itself, rather than staying quiet and letting the vector do its work).

They don't allow this for very specific reasons. Firstly it potentially nullifies results from future studies if the animal has been used in an experiment before.

"There are certainly many situations where two mild experiments would be a lot less traumatic for one animal than a severe experiment on the other. However it sets a dangerous precedent that the relevant authorities want to avoid. 

Contrary to popular belief lab animals are extremely expensive to buy and maintain (in some cases hundreds of times what you would pay in a pet shop) and smaller companies would rather not buy as many. So there could be the potential for sacrificing animal welfare in the name of saving money by keeping an animal that's in pain and using it again. As far as animal ethics go this is not on, and most respectable scientists wouldn't want to be put in this situation.

"Hummm, from what i'm reading here,  i think there's a misconception on the concept of genetically modified monkeys in that cas. They werent actually modified but injected with a self replicant harmless virus that has in its genetic code the schematic for the artificial antibody. And those virus are meant to replicate over and over and over again. Aka, producing the antibody from inside you. So the vector virus is actually the genetically modified thing in order to turn it into a printer of the cure inside your body.

Now, even a patient already infected by HIV would benefit from such a tool. Why ? because HIV is also a self replicant virus that uses our own defensive cells as a benchwork to replicate itself and then blowing it up to dissmeniate its newly created HIV cells. SO in the end, what kills you and actually turns into AIDS it the fact that HIV has destroyed too many of your defensive cells. ( (T4 types which are actually key to your entire immune system) 

Adding to already HIV+ patient that artificial antibody would equal to add a competition to our own T4 cells. From what i understand, the artificial Antibody is made so it is more attractive to HIV so in the end, even for HIV+ patients, it would allow a massive slow down, or even regression of the illness. As our body is constantly producing T4 cells, if somethign is there to prevent HIV from targetting them all the time, pretty much acting as a bait, then you'd see patients go back to perfectly normal T4 cell levels. Which would pretty much mean not being sick at all. Yes you'd still be contagious (and even that remains to be seen) and there are many kinks to rule out, and many testings to be done, but overall it's a very possible solution.

It doesnt kill the virus out of your body. it just traps it. And you can use it at any age as the genetically modified part of it is actually the inoffensive virus that will function in you as a printing machine for the artificial antibody.

Hope i made it simple enough. French here so excuse any error in language.

""" **Those viruses**, injected into monkey muscles, **continued** to produce eCD4-Ig for the 40 weeks of the experiment. âEveryone expects with AAV that this can go on forever,â Farzan says.""

It's the first paragraph that is wrongly phrased. Host DNA is not modified by those viruses. When he says forces cells to produce the construct it's similar to what HIV does with T4 cells. So no, the host DNA is not the target of the genetic modification.

Simple explanation being that modifying the actual host cells is more dangerous than anything if not controlled. The targetted modified cells could have their entire CMH totally modified which would pretty much end up with an Auto-Immune response from the host defense system.",Cazaderon,2015-02-19 00:08:52
AAV is *not* self-replicating. You need to inject a large enough dose that there is sufficient transduction and expression from the initial viral particles. However the integration into the DNA of infected cells is permanent.,smaiyul,2015-02-18 09:16:05
"Yeah, but that remains limited to immune system cells, they dont last forever. AAV uses our cells to express its DNA pretty much like HIV does instead it doesnt kill them then.

My point there was mainly to clarify that the overall DNA host is not the one being actually modified.

Also, the ""infected"" cells dont get their DNA changed, as much as they get a complementary set of DNA that they will translate as well. Otherwise, you'd get into CMH issues.",Cazaderon,2015-02-19 00:11:41
"AAV aren't limited to immune system cells, they infect cells depending on the AAV serotype. Many serotypes infect skeletal muscle such as the AAV1 (AAV serotype 1) used in the article, which is why they injected it intramuscularly. The muscle cell will then express the transgene encoded into the AAV. Other serotypes target the liver, eye, heart etc.

The other thing you mentioned is permanence. HIV infection is permanent, as a retrovirus, it integrates into the chromosomal DNA of infected cells, where it will persist during host cell division. AAV is also permanent, however it is not a retrovirus. It achieves latency through site-specific integration into human chromosome 19, avoiding the deleterious effects of random genome insertion.",smaiyul,2015-02-19 06:52:29

What I took from the article: The engineered protein mimics the structure of the doorway into the human cells that HIV uses- the engineered protein bonds to the HIV body and renders it inactive so it cannot replicate by attaching to a human cell.

This drug might get approved by the FDA for clinical trials based on these results.  First, you test the drug on a small number of healthy people to see what kind of side effects you get.  If you don't see anything too serious then you move on to testing effectiveness in sick patients.  If you still don't see any serious side effects and the drug shows effectiveness in sick humans, then you move on to large scale human trials (thousands of patients).  If your large scale trials are successful then you can submit a final application to the FDA.  The FDA's goal is to act on at least 90% of applications within 10 months (6 months for priority drugs).

The FDA is involved at every single step in this process and the clinical trials themselves can take years.  Most of the drugs you hear about being successful in animals never make it to the New Drug Application (NDA) phase.",kevjohnson,2015-02-18 09:44:45
"There are really 2 reasons why:

1.) The article/announcement is premature and largely based around a small test group and hype that when done on a large scale, lacks the same merit that it had on the smaller test group due to sampling error/test group size/randomness/chance.

2.) Big Pharma likes to buy up patents for certain medications and then just never produce them, leaving the patent on their shelf so nobody else can for the next (10-15ish years) [I forgot what the law says]. Though largely looked at more of a conspiracy theory, there are TONS of medical patents that are bought by these large corporations and just shelved. Some say because they make more money treating you then curing you, others say so they can further test it, etc.

Basically, in the end, anything medical, for it to show merit, takes tens of years of nonstop scrutiny, testing and use.

I've read that the life expectancy is now totally unrelated to HIV infection status. As long as the patient is on the right medication, the virus cannot replicate itself within the human body. The only reason it doesn't count as being ""cured"" is because the virus is able to integrate its genetic coding into the patient's DNA. That means that as long as the bloodstream remains lethal to the viral agent, any copies made from the integrated code will be almost immediately destroyed.

This is kind of like a partial version of *just* those parts that HIV docks to. And if you flood the system with those fake parts, HIV binds to them rather than your cell's parts.

"&gt; Isn't this effectively a cure, since all of the cells in the body are replenished over time?

Here's the problem. 

Some viruses are capable of actually *integrating* their genetic code (DNA or RNA) into the host cell's DNA. 

When that cell reproduces via mitosis or miosis, it keeps all of that genetic code the same (barring any mutations) for the resulting daughter cells. And currently, there's no way of removing that code. 

What this treatment does is it tricks the virus into latching on to the molecules and not any host cells. So, if the recipient of the treatment *has not already been infected*, the virus will be destroyed within the bloodstream and no infection will take place. But otherwise...the genetic coding is with the patient. Which, by the way, is no longer a death sentence or even a severe infection; current HIV medications not only render the bloodstream a lethal environment for HIV (thus completely removing its ability to induce AIDS) but actually, when taken properly, make it almost impossible to transmit the disease via sexual contact.",mypussypops,2015-02-18 17:30:48

"HIV research scientist here...let me explain what's happening in this paper!

So how does HIV-1 work?  HIV-1 is a retrovirus that prefers to infect CD4 T cells.  It gets inside these cells by binding to a protein on the surface of the T cell called CD4.  Once the virus is attached to CD4 on the cell surface, it binds a second cell surface protein (either CXCR4 or CCR5).  Then the virus gets inside the cell and wreaks havoc.  

HIV-1 MUST bind the CD4 protein and either CCR5 or CXCR4 to infect a cell.  So it stands to reason that if you can block the virus from binding those proteins, you can stop the virus from infecting cells. (Important note:  for reasons not yet totally understood, when you contract HIV-1 from someone/something the incoming ""founder virus"" seems to always use CCR5 as the second protein).

So what do we do with this knowledge?  If we could block HIV-1 from binding to CD4 and CCR5, then we could prevent HIV-1 from infecting someone new.  The research team that did this study was trying to create a therapeutic that could block those binding events.

The ""lab-molecule"" described in this paper is a protein that was created by the research team made up of a portion of the CD4 cell surface protein and a small protein chunk that looks like the CCR5 protein (remember: these are the two key proteins HIV-1 needs to bind to infect someone new).  Let's called this protein the Infection Blocker Protein!  They then inserted the DNA sequence required to Infection Blocker Protein into an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV vector).  Think of this DNA sequence like a blue print, and the AAV as a mystical factory that takes the blueprint and cranks out huge amounts of product.  In this application, the product is Infection Blocker Protein.

So now what?  Well, it turns out we can pretty safely inject our engineered AAV vector into people (or monkeys) and it will go to work making the protein we programmed it to make. In this paper, they injected the AAV vector that makes Infection Blocker Protein into monkeys.  The AAV vector then did what it was created to do:  pumped out huge amounts of Infection Blocker Protein.  This protein entered the bloodstream and circulated around the monkey's body.  The research team then started trying to infect the monkeys with SHIV (a modified form of the monkey version of HIV-1 that looks a lot like HIV-1) to see if the Infection Blocker Protein could prevent the incoming virus from infecting any cells.

It appears that the Infection Blocker Protein did what it was designed to do and blocked SHIV from infecting these monkeys.  Is that exciting?  Yes!  Could this method be applied to humans?  Yes!  Will it totally work and should we all start celebrating?  We don't know yet...but this study suggests that we should think about giving it a try in people.  Lot's of promising science fails as we translate from the lab (or lab animal) to human trials.  Let's hope this approach doesn't fail!",hivresearchguy,2015-02-18 08:10:33
"This is fantastic. I've been looking forward to AAV-based bNab vaccines for a while now; this might be even better. HIV could develop resistance to a particular antibody, but it'd be hard to evolve around using the CD4 and CCR5 receptors.",Beo1,2015-02-18 08:25:14

The vector they're using in this case is an adeno-associated virus that has had its ability to integrate into the host cell genome drastically reduced. Normally with AAV vectors, they deliver DNA to a cell's nucleus and it exists as extrachromosomal DNA (in episomal concatemers), and the lack of integration is meant to prevent the interruption of host cell genes which could prevent the development of a tumor, or cancer. These vectors do have a low amount of random integration however, but *hopefully* it isn't frequent enough to pose a risk. That is why more tests are required however.

Additionally, since the protein they are making has homology to host cell proteins, there is a chance that the body may recognize it as a foreign molecule and mount an immune response against it, leading to the development of autoimmunity, but AAV elicits very little immune response in humans, so this is an unlikely occurrence, but of course more tests are warranted.",Kegnaught,2015-02-18 07:32:16

"It's a lot less bleak than us being able to do nothing and just watch people die... aka [the alternative medicinal approach to cancer.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Death)

EDIT: I am so sad to hear of the stories below. I really think, like most things, anti-western approaches to cancer treatment come from an ignorance of what the disease actually is. People think that cancer is some unnatural result of our modern world (which in some cases, and some ways, is true). But cancer has existed as long as there has been biological organisms. Cancer is an extremely *natural* disease. It is our own body, our own cells essentially getting bad instructions or confused signals and thus grow in ways that damage the functional and important parts of our body through inflammation or the blockage of important functions. It is a change of the cell types, and thus losing their proper function. Everybody gets cancer all the time, it's just that our body is prepared (999 times out of a 1000) to catch it and deal with it without our knowing or intervention. It's just that sometimes, in some people, with some bad luck things get out of hand... and the cancer grows too powerfully to be stopped by the body's immune system alone. The cancerous cells break off and get into the bloodstream or lymph stream and spread to the rest of the body (metastasis, stage 4 cancers) and spread all over the body to grow in places they shouldn't, further causing countless problems until we die.

Understanding all this allows one to fully understand how and why we western doctors use the drugs/chemo/radiation therapies we use. Antibiotics have little side effects because they can specifically target things in bacteria that do not even exist in the human body, because we are evolutionarily so different. But cancers are our OWN cells... so how can you design a drug to kill a cancer cell that doesn't kill the rest of our good cells? That's the challenge of the oncologist, and all the pharmaceutical researchers who spend their entire careers trying to come up with better and more specific treatments. And you know what? They've been incredibly successful in the last half a century. Drugs *are* becoming more specific, more targeted to individual cancer types. We're a long way from having side-effect-free cancer treatments (and honestly, that's probably never a possibility given the nature of the disease), but we've made great strides. Cancers that used to kill 80-90% of people who got them, are being caught earlier with good screening in high-risk populations and are being treated successfully. There are many cancers that used to be a death sentence that are not routinely stopped in their tracks. Unfortunately, again, we still have a long way to go, but the future is bright. Medical research needs more funding. And not just the big names like breast cancer, but also prostate cancer and stomach cancer, etc. It *all* deserves funding and smart, passionate people who can creatively come up with new ways to tackle these problems. 

What it *doesn't* need is more ignorance, more disdain for the medical professionals who spend decades studying these things to save people's lives who don't *have* to study any of it in order to receive the benefits of such hard work. We don't need more naturopaths, or acupuncturists, or chiropractors claiming that chemo is ""all bad, unnatural poisons"", or that they have any kind of treatment that is effective. What are their methods? They don't study shit about cancer, except for traditional quackery not backed by any significant research. (I'm only speaking to their approach to cancer, right now, I'm NOT saying we don't need alternative medicine... don't misquote me or misunderstand me)

"One was a ""Tibetan Doctor,"" whose qualifications stemmed from that he worked extensively with natural remedies back in Tibet as a village medicine man.  Long story short, a lady I networked with regarding bladder cancer, since both our parents had it, was trying HARD to convince her father NOT to see this man.  Her father's cancer was aggressive, but early stage.  The best option he had was to have his bladder surgically removed, cutting the cancer off from spreading outside of the organ.  He was vehemently opposed to that idea and claimed the oncologist didn't have his best interests at heart.  So her father sought the Tibetan doctor who offers his services from a hotel room in Brooklyn.  The guy literally has a line out of the door composed of people that shared her father's opinion about modern medicine.  And the way the story ends, the Tibetan doctor put her father on vitamin therapy, her father's cancer eventually spread, and he died a painful death as the disease attacked his kidneys and bones.


The other guy was a ""healer"" who touted apricot seeds as a way to treat cancer, since they contain cyanide.  With enough cyanide in the body, the cancer would die.  He's now showing signs of his cancer returning in the worst way possible and refuses to believe otherwise.

The Tibetan guy claims to be a doctor back in his country, but outside of that, I have not heard of people pressing him for credentials.  He doesn't stay in one location for too long.  He'll be in point A for a month and then fly out to point B, returning back to point A later to refill prescriptions for the dedicated nuts he services.

Are these men doctors?  No, but that, doesn't seem to deter a lucrative group of followers from seeing them,",Mafsto,2015-02-09 09:43:14

"I'm watching this play out in my SO's family right now.  Paternal grandmother passed away a year ago of cancer, paternal grandfather is diagnosed a year later, and the two of them were long-time proponents of alternative medicine.  

Grandmother chose alternative meds and passed away in incredible discomfort, and only went to a western doc after several weeks of agony thinking it would just be acid reflux.  Even after diagnosis, she disregarded the docs' advice in favor of whatever her herbalist sage recommended, and maybe made it another two months.

Grandfather's diagnosis is recent (a couple months at most), and it's not clear what he'll do yet.  I already know SO's dad is a fan of alternative medicine... I listened to a 1/2 hr. treatise on how all of life's woes can be salved by picking the right plant, that it's all right there and we're ignoring it because of the words of some self-proclaimed medical experts.

On the maternal side of the family, the daughter of SO's cousin had serious cancer as a toddler and shook it, and though they accepted the chemo and everything the doc suggested they also credit their behind-doc's-back use of alternative meds with the child's recovery.  Such anecdotal evidence only adds to the fire when discussing the grandparents' cases, and I can only shake my head in confusion at some of the strange things these people say.

The problem with targeted therapies is that they're exclusive to specific proteins within the DNA strand of a cancer cell.  And because one specific type of cancer literally can have hundreds of different DNA sequences, no one targeted therapy will work for them all.  They shrinks the pool of people who can utilize targeted therapies substantially.  Like I said though, as time goes on, this will hopefully change.

"&gt; The problem with targeted therapies is that they're exclusive to specific proteins within the DNA strand of a cancer cell.

Isn't there a sort of targeting that's possible with epidermal growth factor receptors, that are over-expressed in cancer cells?

"There are indeed targeted therapies that utilize epidermal growth receptors in some cancers.  Two that come to my mind would be lung cancer and breast cancer.  The problem is this.  Right now the pharma companies have just begun to scratch the surface of what proteins that can exploit.  And the issue is that cancer is ever evolving within a person.  Just like chemo, eventually a targeted therapy stops working because the cancer cells have mutated an additional protein that offsets the one being silenced by therapy drug.

The good news is this.  Therapy drugs are on the rise and there are clinical trials that use them in tandem with traditional therapies such as chemo.  When they work together it really can push the disease back far.  Mind you, when I talk about cancer, I always refer to late stage cancer as the basis for my examples.  With early stage cancers, chemo, radiation, and surgery still offer good chances of remissions and cures.  So don't be disillusioned by my diatribe.

Do they evolve the ability to stop being targeted (i.e. change their receptor proteins), or do they evolve resistance to whatever drug is being delivered to them?

Because if it's just the latter, technologies like plasmon photothermal therapy that fry cancer tumors using Au nanoparticles and near-IR light would still be effective. They might evolve resistance to this drug or that, but they'll never be able to resist their cell membranes getting fried.",Spats_McGee,2015-02-09 12:16:38
":(  The answer is both.  There have been instances where patients who do not respond to a set of chemo drugs the first time around, sometimes respond VERY WELL a year or two later.  The reason being that the cancer mutated a tolerance to deal with the alternative onslaught of chemo drugs, making it more susceptible to drugs it was previously not weak to.  This does not happen often, but it's goo to bring it up to the oncologist just as another option.

As far as targeted therapies go, yes, the cancer can eventually get around being targeted.  That's how it came into being in the first place.  The very first cell it fooled was the human immune system using proteins such as PD1, PD-L1, and CTA5 (SP on that one). It does the same with targeted therapies after a while.  Like I said, doctors are still in the process of mapping out all the proteins responsible for this specific ability.  In time targeted therapies will be even more effective.

Antibiotics though are very specific in how they work. They are not low specificity toxins by and large, they are used because they interrupt specific proteins or protein structures. And usually, you pick ones that interrupt very critical systems such that the target cell dies.

This is why many antibiotics have very little side effects other than allergic reactions. They're not targeting our cells proteins, but proteins unique to bacteria. This potential approach is taking antibiotics known to kill mitochondrial processes, and giving them in doses such that only very active mitochondrial cells will start dying off.

Not always. If you do pubmed searches, there are examples of paternal mitochondrial contribution. It's rare, and only really detected when maternal mitochondria are defective in some way. One of my human genetics professors postulates that what's really happening is that we're sampling the rare escapers where the very rare event occurs. The rest just fail in utero.

The vast, vast, majority of the time though sperm mitochondria are actively degraded upon fusion with the egg. So you are still correct.

Mitochondrial disorders are also known to increase in severity over generations (classically defined as ""anticipation"" of age on onset or severity of phenotype.) These are can be trinucleotide repeat problems in mitochondrial genes encoded in the nuclear DNA, not the mitochondrial genome. In humans, the mitochondrial genome is remarkably devoid of genes compared to many other species. 

&gt; So if your mom has a mitochondrial disease and the mutations that cause it is in her germline then you will also be giving that disease to 100% of all offspring.

There's also evidence for chimerism in humans. Sometimes the kids luck out because the germline had the healthy mitochondrial. Sometimes not. Makes for some very interesting genetic analysis and usually a very confused grad student.

"Cancer stem cells. 

The (very) basic idea is that there is a population of one to a few cells that are actually responsible for tumorigenesis and that these cells are actually stem cells.  Well, we have had a solid model describing the first part of that statement for a while: one cell acquires several mutations that allow it to rapidly divide when it shouldn't, resist cell death when it shouldn't, and other other sneaky things that ultimately leads to tumor formation.  All of the cells that make up the tumor therefore should be ""clones"" of the original bad guy (though this isn't the whole story, for the sake of simplicity I'll leave it at that).  

So, conventional therapy involves targeting specific elements of these clones. The most commonly targeted aspect is rapid cell division. But there are many problems with this strategy.  For our purposes, the main problem is that these tumors come back, even if treatment appeared to kill all the clones.  So someone had the bright idea that maybe there was another population of cells in the tumor that wasn't rapidly dividing but could still make a whole tumor in the short time span that we see relapses in these patients.  

But that's a paradox: how can a population of cells that is too small to detect form millions of tumor cells without rapidly dividing? Well, the only thing we know that can do that is a stem cell, which divides asymmetrically.  This means that every time a stem cell divides, it produces one cell identical to itself, and one daughter cell that is different that can go on to eventually become a totally different cell or several totally different cells.  This solves our paradox, as the stem cell does not divide rapidly but the daughter cells can.

The proof for this phenomenon is actually fairly strong.  If we take a solid tumor and pick out the stem cells, these cells can form tumors when injected into a mouse.  In fact, sometimes only 5-10 of these cells are required to form the tumor.  On the other hand, if we take all the cells that are not stem cells and inject them into a mouse, tumors will not form even if we injected 100,000 of these non stem cells.

Make sense?

Full disclosure: I am not a csc guy nor do I fully buy this theory.  The truth, I think, lies somewhere in between the two models I described. Also, Cancer is super general term so what may be true for cancer A may not be true for cancer B. And again, this is incredibly watered down so if you want to know more feel free to ask.

"Mitochondria contain most of the proteins involved in apoptosis (cell death), cancer cells have these proteins modulated so they can survive.",Dr_Paul_Proteus,2015-02-08 15:09:30
"Oversimplified: the mitochondria in a cancer cell have been compromised and so allow the cell to use glucose for fuel, which in turn feeds pathogens. 

In a normal cell the mitochondria - rather like a gatekeeper - are what determine the cell will use oxygen. 

About 100 years ago, Dr. Otto Warburg (Nobel Prize winner) discovered that cancer is anaerobic - it does not like oxygen. When we say that this or that virus can cause cancer we're pointing in the right direction. A virus can normally be destroyed by our immune system using oxygen - first there is detection of the antigen, then the pathogen is surrounded by neutrophils as though it were being eaten by a blob. There is a Russian doll sort of action that comes next - the neutrophil engulfs the invader with hypochlorous acid which in turn releases nascent oxygen, which blows the virus to smithereens by tearing it apart at the electron level. 

This shows why oxygen is death to a cancer cell. If a cell pulls in oxygen as fuel, any indwelling virus will be destroyed and the cell will return to it's normal schedule.

Doing pretty much opposite of what this study suggest is actually a proven therapy.  If you either have brand new mitochondria forming, or if you restore the existing mitochondria to a normal state, a compromised cell will stop using glucose as fuel. Any internal pathogen will then die and the cell will basically return to normal - dying if it was supposed to have died. That is where the interest in therapies involving mitochondrial repair come from. Strange that a lot of this stems from 100 year old studies.

[Here is a nice little summation out of Harvard about the whole question of antioxidants](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/antioxidants/) - what they are for, what they really do, and how the term ""antioxidant"" is a bit confusing - it may have been better to have simply called it ""electron donation"".",Rubieroo,2015-02-08 22:19:58
"Thanks for the link! It's kind of funny after reading all that, they hoped the anti-oxidants would be best for avoiding various free-radical driven processes that are harmful in the body, yet studies were mixed at best. And then at the end they mention that there were clear signs that for those at risk for certain cancers already it increased their risk, just like I was suspecting from what you said - seems like someone should do a study trying to relate free-radical damage to the body vs its ability to fight cancer. Or maybe I'm just describing chemo?",58008yawaworht,2015-02-09 07:45:48
"Because antioxidants help fight off the free radicals in your body....free radicals are damaged (oxidized) cells that attach themselves to healthy cells for survival, this causes a very rapid, DNA changing, mutation (such as what is seen in tumors and cancers) of your healthy cells into damaged cells.

"That's what I'm wondering. New mitochondria have the same DNA as the mitochondria in the parent cells, right? If so, what keeps the medication from targeting the mitochondria in healthy cells?",Pie_Minister,2015-02-08 16:05:30
"I think I can chime in here. Mitochondria are very dysfunctional in cancer cells. It's called the Warburg Effect. Otto, back in 1923, thought that tumorigenesis was caused by a complete shutdown of mitochondrial activity (and oxidative phosphorylation), but that has been shown to not be the case. As a consequence, cancer cells predominately rely on glycolysis for their energy production (ATP). This conveys a variety of protective effects to cancer cells, including helping them protect themselves from apoptosis (programmed cell death). 

This effect was capitalized on for the development of FDG-PET scanning for tumor imaging, but has more recently been identified for the creation of a therapeutic window. If you can shut down glycolysis, for example, healthy cells will rely on OXPHOS, but cancer cells won't be able to.

I'm currently in a lab that specializes in this research. We've been developing glycolytic inhibitors for the treatment of cancer, and also looking at other mechanisms of sensitizing cancer cells based on their mitochondrial issues (including mPTP, or permeabilization of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes).",Indoloquinolizidine2,2015-02-08 19:20:02
"Excuse me if I'm missing something but I'm writing my first biochemistry exam today and I couldve sworn that you'd need glycolysis in order to effectively use OXPHOS later on. Refueling of the Krebs cycle by pyruvate -&gt; oxalacetate and what not. Havent dealt with aminoacid metabolism yet so maybe there are enough reactions from that that fill up the cycle but beta-oxidation definitely doesnt.

Fascinating stuff nonetheless!",exikon,2015-02-08 23:31:06
"The cell has many ways to compensate! It's really fascinating stuff. One aspect of the shift in metabolic preference is the idea that cancer cells, growing inside a person, don't really need effective ATP production because they are so inundated with resources. Shutdown of OXPHOS allows for metabolites to be shuttled away to cellular divison pathways, instead, allowing them to continually divide. ",Indoloquinolizidine2,2015-02-09 07:20:24

"The authors state that their approach works ""via the selective targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a.k.a., tumor-initiating cells (TICs).""  -  so it would be the mitochondria of cancer stem cells that are being targeted, I assume.  For a good overview of that 'cancer stem cell' concept:

http://ludwigcenter.stanford.edu/overview/theory.html

""The stem cell theory of cancer proposes that among all cancerous cells, a few act as stem cells that reproduce themselves and sustain the cancer, much like normal stem cells normally renew and sustain our organs and tissues. In this view, cancer cells that are not stem cells can cause problems, but they cannot sustain an attack on our bodies over the long term.""

""The idea that cancer is primarily driven by a smaller population of stem cells has important implications. For instance, many new anti-cancer therapies are evaluated based on their ability to shrink tumors, but if the therapies are not killing the cancer stem cells, the tumor will soon grow back (often with a vexing resistance to the previously used therapy). An analogy would be a weeding technique that is evaluated based on how low it can chop the weed stalksâbut no matter how low the weeks are cut, if the roots arenât taken out, the weeds will just grow back.""

""Another important implication is that it is the cancer stem cells that give rise to metastases (when cancer travels from one part of the body to another) and can also act as a reservoir of cancer cells that may cause a relapse after surgery, radiation or chemotherapy has eliminated all observable signs of a cancer.""",photosymbiont,2015-02-09 03:29:18
"I doubt there's any difference.  Mitochondria are ""inherited"" from the parent cell during mitosis.  Since cancer is simply cell division gone wild (along with lack of programmed death), the mitochondria are most likely the same as the parent cell.  ",aManHasSaid,2015-02-08 14:29:00

We use much less animals because research is getting better at predicting the data, and we have better inbred strains with less genetic variability. This doesn't mean we don't need animals. It means we know how to use each animal more meaningfully.

Monkeys would get toys and treats.  Dogs were supposed to get chew toys and stuff but it didn't seem like anybody was actually really in charge of that so it didn't happen much.  I did raise a bit of a stink about it once and they ordered like $2000 worth of toys though.   

Rabbits got toys to play with.  Oddly enough, they would be given metal rings, like the screw on lid part of a mason jar (minus the inner part).  The rabbits really did seem to like to play with those things.

However, for drug screening, in vitro is usually done first. Usually for cost and speed reasons rather than it being the best model.",,2015-02-08 13:55:45

"Dear lord, this article reads as if it was written by an eight year old! There are tons of problems with this paper, not the least of which is that they don't even show that the antibiotics they test actually affect cancer stem cells. They only use standard cultured cancer cell lines. And importantly, they are not even measuring viability of these cells in the presence of antibiotics, just tumor sphere formation. Then they don't even check whether normal sphere formation for certain non-malignant cell types is unaffected, (i.e. human ES cells). So it's completely comparing apples to oranges. 

It's important to mention as well that there isn't 100% agreement that cancer stem cells even exist. And if they do exist, whether they are present in all malignancies, and what characteristics define them. Not to mention, antibiotics in culture can affect cell line growth, that is why a lot of researchers try not to consistently use them in culturing human cells. Many stem cell lines aren't even supposed to be cultured in the presence of antibiotics. I don't know what the circulating levels of antibiotics in the body are for the ones they tested, but they may be much, much lower than what they can dump in a dish of cells. 

There also isn't complete evidence that all types of cancer cells have high levels of mitochondrial biogenesis. And they haven't shown that ""biogenesis"" (which is itself a fairly vague term) is being affected in the cell lines they're using. Plenty of cancer cells within tumors (which a low oxygen environment) may downregulate aerobic respiration. 

Now there may be tractable anti-cancer targets with regards to mitochondria, and there's plenty of cool cancer mitochondrial biology work being done, but I am hugely skeptical that anything has actually been proven in this paper.

If we can manage that, then we can use any cytotoxic substance that gets later degraded within the cancer cell itself. Regarding these kinda antibiotics, In vivo, these antibiotics would also harm the mitochondria of our normal cells, thus it's also harmful for the patient.

There won't be one cure or one treatment. Treatments in the future will be tailored. I see antibody therapy in cancer research as a means to possibly filter metastatic cancer cells within the blood vessels and the lymph, before they can settle down and grow. That would be very desirable, as metastasis is what makes cancer so dangerous. In a surgery some cancer cells can seperate and reach the bloodflow and soon the patient might get a new tumor.

They are and they are not. I understand what you are saying, but it's not entirely accurate. Cancer cells are different in that they have a different genetic code due to mutation.

"Ahh, but mutation alone doesn't predispose malignancy once established. Epigenetic programs are emerging paradigms of oncogenesis and therapy response. Just because you have a transposition of one tumor suppressor, un recognized SNP, doesn't convince repair mechanisms. The established dogma is that 6 mutations must exist to generate a malignant cell, so there is an inherent flaw in recognition, not by immune cells but the response/repair mechanisms. They are our cells in that 1,2,3..5 mutations can exist at any one time and no malignancy is conferred, your cells would theoretically persist in an evolutionary bottleneck.. Furthermore, we can't force immune cells to recognize an aberrant mutation in the intracellular ATP pocket of EGFR.

"It is at normal dosage levels. The info on that was ripped right from the herceptin wiki page. We actually discussed herceptin specifically in my graduate molecular biology class last week, and the cardiac issues were mentioned during that discussion.

The general jist is that all cancer treatments(chemo, antibodies, etc) have detrimental side effects and are far too blunt. One of the issues with targeting receptors, in general, is that each receptor regulates so many things. It's virtually impossible to get a single desired effect when you target them.

The reason people use these treatments is that they're better than the alternative of keeping the cancer. One of the treatments in use right now involved actually *increasing* the number of mutations in the cancer cells until they exceed a threshold of mutations, beyond which the cell cannot survive. This creates mutations in other, healthy cells, but the prospect of maybe having cancer again or other health problems in the future is appealing compared to having cancer now. In the case of herceptin, getting rid of your breast cancer is worth the statistically significant but low chance of cardiac issues(low compared to the chance of the cancer being fatal).

The holy grail here is finding something that is completely specific to cancer cells that can be targeted so healthy cells will be completely left alone and fine. Unfortunately, we don't have that target yet.",RaymondLuxury-Yacht,2015-02-08 16:03:15

"Not true, you make it sound like that's the only definition of cancer. There are plenty of rapidly growing cell types that aren't cancer because to put it simply, they know know when to stop. There are a number of different parameters that differentiate a cancerous cell from a normal cell and high metabolism is just one of them.

This treatment will inevitably have problems with off-target activity because of how broad spectrum it aims to be. In targeting mitochondrial rich cells you will undoubtedly see off-target effects in stem cells, myocytes, neurons and certain epithelial cells, the key is whether there is a therapeutic window large enough to make these effects manageable, so that the side effects aren't too severe.  

If you're expecting to see a broad-spectrum safe treatment for cancer come of this then I have some bad news for you. To use your analogy, the human body is like a bunch of people at a posionous buffet who eat at different speeds. Some cells love to overeat when they're young but learn that if they keep going at that rate when they're 30 they're going to become obese so they eventually stop.

"&gt; The antibiotics have already been shown to be safe to year human illness.

Yes, in a dosage regimen appropriate for treating bacterial infections. When re-purposing drugs for chemotherapy you will undoubtedly have to increase the dose in order to appropriately target cancer cells. The question, as I said, is whether this increase will keep these drugs within a therapeutic window appropriate for use as a chemotherapy drug.

To look at a similar example in reverse the chemotherapy drug methotrexate was re-purposed for use in rheumatoid arthritis but at a much lower dose, so the side effects are almost completely attenuated. There is no way it would be licensed for use in RA if the dose had to be as high as it did for chemotherapy because you would kill more patients than you would save.

&gt;They also already give cancer patients some of these antibiotics when infection hit. What's most remarkable is that these patients showed an increase in 1yr survival rate which was previously attributed to preventing infection but now calls for further researchers.

It calls for further research because you're immediately looking at a correlation and implying causation given this new information. There's no evidence to suggest that it is because of the antibiotic effect against cancer and not prevention of infection, damage to the immune system is a common side effect of a number of chemotherapy drugs that patients in that sample size would have been taking.

This is interesting and does call for more research, it doesn't call for making wild claims like this is going to be a chemotherapy treatment that's completely safe for humans with only in vitro data as evidence.",croutonicus,2015-02-08 15:02:09

"I don't think it's that simple. Nearly all antibiotics have a toxic dose, and at high concentrations many of the protein synthesis inhibitors can impair mammalian protein  synthesis as well. Tetracycline, one of the antibiotics in this paper, is contraindicated in children, for example. Some, like aminoglycosides, have an incredibly low therapeutic index. In addition, antibiotics may target normal flora, which may cause disease as well due the invasion of opportunistic bacteria.

Overall, the transition from in vitro to in vivo isn't as simple as you'd think. There are many factors that come into play, and such a broad-spectrum therapy ignores too many. It would be amazing if they could find a therapeutic dose that doesn't cause harmful side effects while effectively treating a metastatic cancer - whether that's feasible or not, I don't know.

Not with a clear mechanism though. It is more likely (although unconfirmed) that the antibiotics simply reduce mortality linked to bacterial infection in immunocompromised chemotherapy patients. 

&gt; There are at least a dozen classes of antibiotics, all of which work differently.

Most antibiotics target uniquely prokaryotic processes or structures so wouldn't be useful. The antibiotics discussed in this paper inhibit mitochondrial binary fission which isn't unique to bacteria, however the beta lactams for example target cell wall structural integrity, a structure not present in mammalian cells. The class of antibiotics here are the only class with a confirmed effect and there's no reason to think it's due to their antibacterial effect.

&gt; Pehaps the antibiotics weaken the gluttonous cancer cells so that less chemo is needed thus less side effects from the chemo

As mitochondria aren't unique to cancer (they may be highly expressed but they're not the only cell to be so) it is unlikely this radiosensitisation would be unique to cancer. 

&gt;Perhaps a radioactive compund bound to the antibiotics to deliver targeted radiation to cancers?

These antibiotics aren't cell selective they would just have a more detrimental effect to cancer cells. You wouldn't see targetted or selective treatment with this method, only one that is more selective for cancer. 

&gt;Normal cells would not take in enough of the antibiotic to allow the radioactivity to reach lethal levels.

"In the case of leukemia they only need to take a blood sample and check the concentration of leukemia cells. It's the white blood cells in your body that turn into cancer cells, which you want to get rid off. The leukemia cells don't go into tissue. You can check and count for them under a microscope. They probably check it a few times to make sure, that there are really no more leukemia cells. If there are no more, than you are good to go. Basically you would be cured of your cancer. Of course you can't be 100 % sure that all leukemia cells have been eliminated, but fingers crossed. The problem with leukemia is that the white blood cells which have turned into cancer cells are your immune system. Since your immune system has now been destroyed you will need a new immune system, and that's where the bone marrow transplant comes into play. This is a form of stem cell therapy. You transplant white blood stem cells to get a new immune syste. The good news for you is that small children have a very good chance to survive leukemia.

"I've been trying to come up with an answer to this for over an hour now. I'm sorry but I don't think I can give you a good enough answer. There's just too much that I don't know.

I do know that cancer cells grow very quick, and use up a lot of energy, which is provided by the mitochondria. This treatment is supposed to affect cancer cells because of their high energy demand. 
Cells have ways of destroying mitochondria and making new ones, because mitochondria are sometimes damaged. So this treatment is likely to affect this process.

I don't know for example how long a neuron could survive without being able to make new mitochondria, but I imagine it can't be too long. 
I think for this treatment to work without leaving permanent side effects you'd have to get treated just long enough so that the cancer cells get damaged beyond repair, without damaging your neurons.

I did come up with an analogy though...
Imagine you have 20 healthy adults. 10 of these are cancer cells, 10 are your neurons/ muscle cells. You make everyone stop eating at the same time. You tell the neurons/muscles to run at 50% of their max speed, and then tell the cancer cells to run at 100% speed (so they're using more energy). After a couple days of just running with no food, you might have some dead cancer cells, but you might also have some dead neurons/muscle cells.

However from what I know about mitochondrial function and cancer, most cancer tissue are acclimatised to hypoxia, which means they rely very little on their mitochondria to provide energy. Cells without mitochondria at all (Rho0 cells) has been generated before and they only need a few additional supplements (mainly uridine which can only be synthesised in the mitochondria) to be viable in culture, and chances are they will be fine inside a living body where various nucleotides are easy to come by. Besides that point, cancer stems cells are often poorly accessible since it is often embedded in other tissue which may metabolise or export the drug so it is probably much harder to develop therapy based on this approach. 

Another point is that tetracycline is known to have toxic effects to cells at 50uM, viability alone does not tell the whole story.

"the Warburg effect popped into my head as well. here's a couple ideas i had why this might work though:

1. CSC mitochondria are different from the mitochondria of regular cells
2. mitochondria are involved in a bunch of death pathways

Basically, although the CSC's are not metabolically dependent, most of the various oncogenic/tumor suppressor pathways are still extant. There's some that are broken, but my hunch is that the break acts as a dam to prevent cell death, and a lot of pressure builds up behind that dam if that kind of makes sense.

"The paradox of cancer cells is that despite many tumors being highly vascularized, they don't use aerobic respiration pathways and preferentially produce energy by anaerobic glycolysis. Because this tends to differentiate them from healthy cells, the metabolic pathway has actually become a target for some therapeutics (google DCA for example). A lot of these targets are really interesting and there are some really cool links being discovered.

For example, tRNA has been found to bind to Cytochrome C, and inhibits its activity. Cytochrome C has a role aerobic respiration in the mitochondria, and when released from the mitochondria it triggers apoptosis (regulated cell death). Cancer cells have highly elevated tRNA levels, which could inhibit apoptosis and make cancer cells harder to kill, while also inhibiting aerobic respiration and shifting metabolism to anaerobic pathways. It's not really known if this is a cause or effect but I think in the next few years this will become a very hot topic in cancer research, if it's not already. ",Pteryx86,2015-02-08 18:53:00

On the other hand, you'd be surprised how often protocols are handed down from person to person without proper context, and ultimately one lab to another without any validation because *this is how it has always been done*. This happens on all levels and the thought that many labs are churning out irrelevant data is really disturbing. 

For example, most pre-made DMEM contains 3.7g/L of sodium bicarbonate buffer which is matched to the 10% CO2 atompshere commonly used back when the media was developed. However when the same media is used with a 5% CO2 incubator, the pH drifts up and the cells will be growing under alkalosis until the lactic acid build-up eventually lowers the pH after 2-3 days in culture. 

ATCC is aware of this problem, they caution against this and actually offer media matched to 5% CO2.

"One thing to note here is that they were targeting cancer STEM CELLS, not cancer cells. There is a slight difference. Cancer stem cells are stem cells (e.g. stem cells in the skin, intestine, testes, bone marrow, etc) that have become cancerous and are thought to initiate recurrent cancers. Our current chemo options target cells that divide very quickly, but cancer stem cells divide very slowly (the cells they turn into after division would be more like traditional cancer cells and divide quickly). This means that traditional chemos kill the ""offspring cells"" of cancer stem cells, but not the actual source of them (the stem cells). This would lead to recurrence of the cancer pretty quickly b/c the source is still alive and well. If this therapy works, this would be a great way to go right to the source of these cancer cells.

However, the idea that these cancerous stem cells could contribute to cancer is pretty new, and right now is frankly just a hypothesis. Right now scientists are still gathering evidence that they even exist (which is pretty convincing evidence, btw). It's thought that a very low number of cancers would be caused by cancer stem cells, but the ones they do cause would be very difficult to fully treat and likely to recur.

Also, most cancer cells don't divide rapidly. They can, if they had the necessary mutations for that or are of certain fast dividing cell types, but it's not needed to be classified as cancer cell.

I am curious because inducible gene expression systems (like Tet-Off/Tet-On) used in cancer research for endogenous expression of a peptide frequently utilize doxycycline as an inducer.  If one were using this system to express a gene that could transactivate apoptotic genes, could doxycycline itself be contributing to cell death?

Good catch.  But those using the system control for that possibility by measuring cell death in both a population expressing their transgene and a population that just has an empty expression vector.  So any off target effects are measured with treatment + empty vector and then the death of cells expressing the transgene is normalized to the control to account for these effects.,naughtynurses2,2015-02-08 15:58:57
"Yes, this is true. Although I am curious because I am wondering if this would make the Tet-On system more difficult to use, or perhaps inferior to an alternative for endogenous expression of an apoptosis promoting gene in an inducible cancer stem cell line. If your control vector is achieving high cell kill, it may limit your ability to show the efficacy of a peptide. Am I correct in drawing this conclusion? ",pathobiology,2015-02-08 16:10:51
Definitely correct. You have to hope that they would not use a system that demonstrates a severe increase in apoptosis in the control group.

"Most existing chemotherapies already work something like this, except not by targeting mitochondrial alterations, but by targeting proteins necessary for rapid cell division (which is characteristic of tumor cells). The problem is that chemotherapy therefore also kills all the cells in us that are normally rapidly-dividing. Those are stem cells.

So, targeting 'stem-ness' will likely lead to the same side effects as most traditional chemotherapies, which also tend to kill stem cells. Hair production and gut integrity rely on stem cells. When chemotherapy (accidentally) kills them in addition to the 'stem-like' cancer cells, that's why your hair falls out and you have terrible gastrointestinal problems.

TL;DR: This 'new' approach does basically the same thing as old approaches, and will likely have the same side effects.

The first paper says that ""tetracyclines and chemically modified tetracyclines inhibit the activity of several matrix metalloproteinases"" which is interesting since this paper suggests that sphere formation is inhibited. Kind of the opposite of what I'd expect.

And the second indicates that ""doxycycline exerts its antitumor effect by activating proapoptotic genes, inhibiting IL-8 expression, and suppressing antiapoptotic genes"".

what is the powerhouse of the cell?,SynthesisP,2015-02-13 13:08:42
"Most human cells have an organelle called  mitochondria. It converts the energy stored in sugar to a form called ATP which the other parts of the cell can use as ""fuel"" more efficiently than they can use sugar directly.  

Cancer cells use a lot of more energy than non-cancerous cells so if you knock out the mitochondria, you've killed the cancer.

That's the general idea. Just realize it's a long way to proving this approach works - this paper is just one of many steps.",nobodyspecial,2015-02-13 14:34:40

"Cancer is rapid unchecked cell multiplication. A tumor is just a bunch of cells growing without organization basically.

For a cell to grow and multiple, it uses a lot of energy.

Mitochondria is the organelle of a cell that is the cells ""energy source"". It basically converts food energy into cell energy that the cell can use to perform functions, such as growing and multiplying.

Since cancer is unchecked growth of cells, it's likely that something that cancers have in common is increased mitochondria usage.

Antibiotics as far as I know are drugs that target a specific cell mechanism that causes the cell to be unable to grow and multiply. For example, penicillin blocks an essential part of bacteria that is required for successfully splitting one cell into two. This part is not found in human cells so the antibiotic prevents the bacterial cell from splitting but (ideally) has no effect on the human.

So this article describes an antibiotic that specifically targets mitochondria. Because cancer growth may be connected to high mitochondria usage, such an antibiotic would target cancer cells more than the rest of our cells. This would cause cancer cells to be unable to grow and multiply. This would prevent tumors.

This, however, would likely still target a lot of our other cells, likely resulting in bad side effects, but hopefully not as bad as the cancer cells.

I'm not a cancer researcher. I have a degree in neuroscience however and studied a lot of biology. I can answer some general questions but more specific questions will likely be over my head. Just wanted to inform you on the level of information you just received!",Expert-Expert,2015-02-08 13:56:22

"I usually find cancer research articles posted here to have merit, but the claims made here are extremely farfetched. They're leaping from antibiotics --&gt; mitochondria --&gt; cancer stem cells --&gt; therapy. None of these links are well-established. There may be 'some evidence' for each of these individual links, but to suggest that you can effectively cure cancer through this pathway? By treating it like an 'infectious disease'? 

The figures from this paper seem to show that antibiotics have an effect on sphere formation in cancer cell lines. Sphere formation is supposedly an assay for cancer stem cells, but there's controversy on whether cancer stem cells even exist as a distinct subset of cancer cells or if there's any value in trying to target them. Maybe further research will support some of these links, but I doubt this will have much of an impact on therapy.",flutterfly28,2015-02-08 14:30:37

"The problem with using cheap off-patent antibiotics to treat cancer is that no private company will pay for the clinical trials because it's impossible to enforce a monopoly price and recover the costs of those clinical trials (which can be hundreds of millions of dollars to get to Phase III). Even if a pharmaceutical company tweaked the molecules to get a patent, if the off patent drugs work just as well, you can't make a business case because doctors/patients will learn to use the cheap off-patent versions. 

This is why its not a good idea to rely solely on the patent system for incentivising drug development and why we need alternative incentives such as prizes and increased public funding. For using a proposed crowdfunded prize as a solution to this problem check out http://www.crowdfundedcures.org/about/. ",MedicalPrize,2015-02-09 01:32:44

And getting public funding for large clinical trials is even less likely vs getting something for pre-clinical/basic research. The fact is, under the current system pharmaceutical companies are expected to do the heavy lifting when it comes to clinical trials. Publicly funded clinical trials, when they happen, are typically small and underfunded, Phase IIa if you are lucky.

"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that that's how cancer works. Cancer isn't a disease in the sense that it's caused by bacteria, but rather occurs when something (even random chance) causes dividing cells to mutate into something that is harmful to the surrounding tissue. So, when that mutated cell then continues to reproduce, it creates more like it, which spread this harmful gene further and further. After this happens so many times, you end up with a tumor.

In short, no. It would not create ""super cancers"" because you're not thinning the herd like what happens with super bacteria and viruses.",basswalker93,2015-02-08 13:19:45

So don't worry about transmissible super-cancer, worry about the common cold.

"You are not quite correct. Fresh Neonates and babies in the womb have 'embryonic' stem cells which can quite literally become any cell type. For a long time scientists didn't quite know that the human body actually possess multiple types of stem cells. Today, we are aware of many types of stem cells, some of which can become many different types of cells, even in adults! Of course, they aren't as easy to manipulate and it has taken decades of research for us to get to the point where we can treat these progenitor stem cells with various growth factors and chemicals to influence them to become other cell lines. Yet in the human body, even as adults, we have several different types of stem cells that are able to further differentiate into a variety of useful tissues. For example, satellite cells in muscle tissue are activated after injury or during muscle building to become muscle fibres. 

In the context of cancer, it was recently found that mutations in the genes of these otherwise differentiated stem cells could cause them to express genes that are usually deactivated, thus making them totipotent and sometimes cancerous. These stem cells could potentially be the start of a tumor and, due to their ability of act like many cell types at once, they could nest all around your body. It is also thought that cancer stem cells are the basis of a lot of tumors and, if not killed or removed with surgery, will survive to continue causing cancer in an individual. They are a widely debated topic but at this point it is accepted that they do exist and contribute to cancer in some way.

"I'd guess that the kids ate more fruits and veggies because those are the sides. Usually at public schools, the main dish is a meat or starch. As someone else in the thread said, after recess they were ravenous as a child going into lunch. In other words, the kids probably ate the whole plate due to post-excersize hunger.",plokijuh1229,2015-01-13 18:35:22

Teacher here. The way school lunch works is the kids get portions of everything including fruits and veggies. If the kids are hungrier they will eat the fruits and veggies instead of throwing them away. They can't just go get more Mac and cheese or pizza. ,S_1000_T,2015-01-14 05:22:57

"I can see where you're coming from but imagine if a kid has a plate with a slice of lasagna, a side of asparagus and broccoli, a fruit salad and a cookie. If they only eat the lasagna and cookie, they are inherently not going to be eating as healthy and balanced of a meal as they would if they included the asparagus and broccoli with a dish of apples, bananas, strawberries and kiwi, you know?",phoenixink,2015-01-13 19:17:19
"Not if they're upping their caloric intake beyond what they're spending to do it, no. That's the problem underlying the American ""food pyramid"" and the lobbying behind it. Because every industry had lobbyists, they couldn't say ""eat less"" of anything, only ""eat more."" Eating more is a big problem in the US. We want kids to eat the asparagus and fruit salad *instead* of the cookie, not *in addition* to it. Hell, half a cup of canned fruit salad has something like 13 or 14g of sugar in it. I'd rather they have it than the equivalent in cookies, but I'd rather they have neither, honestly. 

I mean part of it is, I'm damned cynical. I live in a country where pizza is classified as a vegetable (I kid you not). So yeah, if they're eating an apple, I'm happy. But we're probably talking about something that comes in a tub of HFCS. ",medievalvellum,2015-01-14 05:31:10

College in America is a joke. I swear I learned far more in high school. Yes, you could get away with hardly learning anything in high school, but if you payed attention you learned more than you ever possibly could in college.

It baffles me that you need anywhere from a Master's to a Doctorate to teach in college, but the average high school teacher with merely a Bachelor's will often be the much better teacher. Not to say there aren't amazing professors, but most professors you come by in college range from meh to awful.",shitineedglasses,2015-01-13 17:39:42

In high school we just had a 1 hour lunch break, with no limits on where we could roam in or outside the school. No permission form required to leave the grounds.

You have one gym class once during your 4 years and its your choice to take other classes for fitness if they are offered.

I think the study is saying that you should send the kids out to play, then bring them in and feed them right before class starts again.

Either way the Australian system still works better, You tell the kids they've got 30 minutes in the morning ('play lunch' as we called it) and 1 hour around midday and they can spend that how they please, playing or eating in whatever order they want.

Otherwise you run into issues with kids who are diabetic or fasting having to sit out of play time because they haven't been able to have a snack before play.",mundabit,2015-01-13 16:26:19

"Typically you actually have two, you have one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  This actually comes from the fact that the second recess and lunch are one period so you have 30 minutes to eat and have recess.  The faster you eat the more free time you have.  The problem is that 30 minutes is barely enough time to enjoy a good meal by itself, the kids end up rushing to eat everything as fast as possible so they can play.  When you swap it so recess is first and then you have a set time for lunch where they can not leave early you are in no rush to eat so you are more likely to clear your plate.  The same trend even continues into high school where you get a 30- 50 minute lunch period(depending on the school), the faster you eat the more time you have to talk with friends/study/etc.  ",Maethor_derien,2015-01-13 15:13:40

Still, the temptation to join friends outside is hard for a 6 year old to resist at times.

I can say this has easily been my most productive week in a long time.

I think high schools need to adopt the college approach.  A full load should only be five or six classes, not seven like mine is.  And we should start later and only have or two classes a day.

"I honestly wouldn't mind if my highschool started at 9:00 as opposed to the 7:30 time it normally starts at. To get a general idea of who I am I play baseball for the school, am I member of a few clubs, and am an AP student. 


My baseball practices sometimes go almost/to dark (anywhere between 6:00-6:30 depending on time of year) and they start around 2:30 (school gets out at 2:10). We would most likely practice till dark every day, and thanks to no lights on the field it would actually take away from total practice time. Game days I may need to leave school a class or two early depending on how far away it is, but in reality that will only be a few days out of the year.


I get to sleep in, will be more well rested in early classes and be able to stay awake better. I'll be tentative by the time I get to school, and with AP Calc first period I would really benefit from being 100% cognitive when I have to learn about derivative tests and implicit differentiation.


I'm a procrastinator, I often do my homework in the mornings and if I have a lot of stuff to do then so be it, I have even more time to get my homework done and I don't have to use up my nights.


Senior year (currently a Junior) I only need to take 4 classes. I can elect to take a late start, not have to come to school until 11 every day, not have any traffic to worry about. If I choose to take an early release I would still get out at around 1:30 which would keep school from getting in the way of other responsibilities I might have.


Of course, my situation doesn't represent the majority, these are my own opinions and in no way validates how the change was a good one. I just wanted to share my personal thoughts to maybe show how some students might have argued it affected them positively.",jeffthedunker,2015-01-13 19:14:24

Maybe the ones that were happy were such a small minority that they didn't want to speak out against it, though.

Even from your own situation, I can see others in your spot being unhappy with it unless I'm misunderstanding something. You either stop practice at the same time regardless of the time change, which means you get less practice (bad/unhappy people). Or it is extended even later to where you are playing in the dark (bad/unhappy people). Maybe you're fine with having less practice, but I'm sure your coach and some of your teammates would not be thrilled with having a disadvantage due to not having enough time to practice every day.

Honestly, the main reason I was fine with the change is because I only needed to take 5 classes instead of 6. I got out early almost every day except thursdays, so it was like I had a later start to the day but still got out at the same time as I had in previous years. If I had to get out late every day due to taking 6 classes, I'm not sure I would be happy about it. In Florida, the 2 hour difference between 1 pm and 3 pm makes a huge difference in how awful it feels outside. So a benefit to getting out earlier is not being so miserable going home.",iamkoalafied,2015-01-13 19:31:06

"I'm only 23. I could pull up news articles about it, but I'd rather not identify myself in that way (although anyone who is similarly aged from my area should be able to recognize it from the description I've already given). There was a massive protest at my school in particular. 1st period, people planned to go to class and as soon as the bell rang, leave class to have a ""standing protest"" in the main open area of my school. People had signs, were shouting chants, etc. They remained until the school admin basically threatened to kick everyone out of school for it or so I heard from my friends who attended it (don't think they actually could have done that but yeah).

Some students actually went off of school property instead of staying inside the school. Some students were interviewed by local news complaining about it. It was a huge deal. I believe similar things happened at other schools in the district, but I only remember my school's reaction because I was there. There were also protests that were going on at my school district's headquarters (not sure if that's the right term). Parents were also upset, mostly because their high school children took care of their younger children after school and now those children would either have to be alone or go to some kind of daycare for an hour or two. And they changed it back to normal the next year, mostly from the largely negative reactions and the fact that it didn't benefit the county financially in any way.",iamkoalafied,2015-01-13 20:40:50

"Part of the criticism he asserted was that we live far as fuck from everything. It's really dumb but it's part of the economics of the way we subsidize the shit out of roads (car/gas taxes only pay about half of highway maintenance and nothing for roads, it's why other countries have such expensive gas, higher taxes to cover it).

Canada for some reason has performed a lot better, and also doesn't subsidize home ownership by giving huge tax breaks to home owners, which allows more density to be created. So for example we live in a beautiful neighborhood of the city and pay $100 each for bus passes, but most things are within a short walk anyway as our street is mixed residential/commercial.

To be honest, the silliest part of your response is that there's no bus service. I think that's obscene that they would include you in a school catchment area but not send your area a school bus. My husband grew up in a rural as shit area of Quebec in a farming town and they sent a school bus more than 2 hours away to his town because there was no high school in his area.

I grew up in the US, so I understand where you're coming from, but you should understand that this a problem with our society as a whole and not necessarily with specific individuals. We need to tackle it in numerous ways. The urban sprawl and everyone driving everywhere in their car-bubble is symptomatic of how anti-social and paranoid we've become.",machinedog,2015-01-13 20:03:04
"Thanks for your response. I did leave details out of my comment because I was speaking out of emotion. I lived in a poor neighborhood with some of the worst schools in the state, and was sent to a private school in the hopes that I would be able to acquire a decent education despite living in a area where the public schools have considerably failed. In that case, the school has no responsibility to bus me, and I very well should have gotten over having difficulty with late starts and schedule changes.

I wasn't aware of the system in Canada. It must be pleasant to have a mixed residebtial and commercial area and have convenient access to goods and services. Even in some of theost modern towns I have personally visited here, this is not the case.

I am very interested in the differences between the suburban lifestyle that has developed in the US and the formation of communities in other parts of the world. I am certainly happy to be at college where I never have to get in a vehicle if I don't want to and am within walking distance of all necessities. In fact, one of the major goals of my study is to advocate sustainable lifestyles and practices for individuals, communities, and companies which affect the environment as well. I hope to tackle the societal problem of some aspects of modern lifestyles as you mentioned.

Good luck in college! I think you have a bright future. :)

P.S. Yeah, most small towns aren't like what I described, but a much larger percentage of Canadians live in cities rather than small towns compared to the US. It's kind of crazy to me here how you can leave the confines of your city and just be in the middle of absolutely nowhere within like 15 min drive. The suburbs just aren't AS huge of a thing here, (although they are still a thing). And even then, the suburbs are usually very well serviced by public transit. Like, in Ottawa, the city mandates that there be a public transit stop within 500 meters of every home, and for the most part you can get anywhere in the city with just 1-2 buses. That being said, Canada is a big country, and there are still plenty of towns outside of cities that don't have any form of public transit and are quite spread out.

"That's the point, though. We live far as fuck from everything so there is no solution. Majority of my friends, including me, lived 20min+ away from the high school. Biking and walking are impossible solutions, and where I and many friends lived (different cities entirely) there is no bus service to and from. I guess one of my friends could have taken the city bus, but it would have been about 2.5hours *one way.*

So basically nothing you said helps and there is still the problem of getting a 14 year old to high school if their school starts after your workday begins.

Even if later start days were for upperclassmen only (a lot more feasible) there are just too many kids with younger siblings to make it practical. They'd most likely be tasked to drive their sibling in and then have to wait around for their own school day to begin.",lalala-,2015-01-13 23:49:56

"At my school (I'm a senior in high school btw) it is ""required"" that you grab a vegtable or fruit to go along with your lunch. Because the lunch lady will literally yell at you if you don't, everyone just grabs it and literally throws it right into the trash immediately after. There is a less than 5 second period where the student is holding the fruit/vegetable  before it lands directly in a trash bin. The school now can say ""Students have taken all the fruit and vegtables!"" while leaving out the fact that over 90% of it (at least) is being thrown away.

"&gt; Video games have been shown to develop parts of the brain too I think, but nothing beats actively going out to play. Especially adventure or search games, which were my favorite when I was little.

Yep. I don't want to sound like one of those old people, but I sort of feel bad for kids today. We had video games when I was a kid, but we didn't play them much. I didn't have my first console until I was in the fourth grade and I don't remember playing many games before that. There's nothing like getting a couple of the neighbor kids together, going into the woods and having a full day of exploration and adventure. I don't know if a lot of kids do this anymore. Of course I didn't grow up in an urban environment (where we lived was about halfway between suburb and rural) so maybe I'm a little biased. 

&gt; I hope they find a way to fix things so boys do better in school again.

We just need to get more men into elementary school teaching. It's about as simple as that, yet for some reason male elementary school teachers are disappearing. I never had one, my first male teacher was in 5th grade. Our current system was set up and is run by women, who don't seem to understand what boys need and would rather treat them as defective girls.

That, and teachers don't always get the best salary in comparison to other positions. My first male teacher I had in fourth grade. Mainly math teachers were male ones for me, and they always taught most effectively (although I'm female) and were on top of that hilarious!

When you say you got no recess, what happened at lunch?

In the UK, in my area at least, we generally got 15 mins between the start of the day and lunch time. Then 1 hour for lunch time. 

In my younger years (before secondary school) lunch time was set out where the first half an hour was for people who got school provided food, the second half an hour was for people who came with their own food. I always had my own food, we were supposed to make our way into the canteen to eat it but I generally ignored that rule and snacked my way through lunch time.

In middle school (grades 7-9) we got a 35 minute lunch with a 15 minute ""Snack Break"" late afternoon. We had gym class but it really just consisted of doing sit ups, push ups and sometime dodge-ball but we had tests. Once, for a whole year, we literally didn't do anything but sit in a room. 

Highschool (Grade 10-12) a student had to sign up for gym and we only got 20min for lunch. But at that point it really didn't matter.

I guess since we had a gym class and they used that in place of recess but most of the time it was highly structured and was graded which is a little different.

"One day your kid is going to realize that he can eat only the treat and throw the rest of the food in the trash. Our kids realized this by about 2nd/3rd grade, and we learned very quickly to balance out what's healthy with what they still will enjoy eating (i.e. asked them what type of lunch meat, whether they want mustard, settled with no tomatoes as long as they have lettuce).

Or you're going to deal with the fact that children share and make trades all the time. My son once traded half a turkey sandwich for some cookies. He told me about it; I told him congrats - I can't enforce not trading food because I'm not there and I'd rather my son be honest with me than lie to my face about what he's doing.

Just saying - it's good to instill healthy eating and try to give your kid a proper lunch, but kids aren't stupid and learn very quickly how to manipulate the world to their benefit. At some point in time pushing something too hard can often times result in backfiring. I hope that doesn't happen to you though and that your kid is perfect and always listens :p",skrilled,2015-01-13 17:15:17

To change anything to do with school times is nearly impossible. It has been known that kids are more alert if schools change their hours to an hour later. So to change the period of leisure to eating is impossible to any schoolboard.,Charel,2015-01-14 08:06:49

the problem is that the taxpayers don't want to pay for anything nicer.  I'd take a hike in property tax to pay for it.  I just figured up really quick that it would cost the average household less than $80 a year in my district to add an extra dollar for every meal for every student for the whole school year.  that's not even $7 a month.,durrtyurr,2015-01-13 14:12:06
"&gt; Kids eat a 100% more fruits and vegetables if that's all you give them. 

Actually, I'd be willing to bet that there'd be a decent number of children who'd eat little to none of their lunch and toss the entire thing (possibly eating extra snacks from home or vending machines, if they could swing it).  And not eating lunch would lead to lower concentration/grades.

*""Three of the schools switched recess to before lunch while four schools continued to hold recess after lunch.

*After analyzing 22,939 data points, the researchers concluded that in the schools that switched recess to before lunch children ate 54% more fruits and vegetables.

"Bad idea. Kids need a lot of calories for their size, and trying to get them to eat a healthy-sized lunch of 100% fruits and vegetables is difficult even in a home setting, much the less a cafeteria. In addition, they'll need some specific fruits if they're going to have the energy to finish the day- kids are notoriously tired in the afternoons and carbs/sugars are energy. They're also going to need protein which very few fruits and veggies provide, and then not in complete forms. Then you need to consider price vs. taste, since the cheap fruits and veggies are barely fit for human consumption. Cutting out cereals, meats, and dairy from a kid's diet, even for one meal a day, just isn't viable. (we should also consider that a lot of kids count on school lunches as the only real meal of the day, so even though this might not harm kids who are heading home to mom's spaghetti, those that aren't getting dinner need that meat and milk)

I'm also going to say that the reason a lot of fruits and veggies get thrown away is because they taste like shit. My schools all served up tons of mushy green beans, brownish peas, limp &amp; unwashed lettuce, and soggy carrots that all got thrown into the trash. Quality produce with salt, pepper, butter, ranch, and a bit of cheese would be a much different story. A little bit of salt and fat won't harm kids anything like learning to hate vegetables will. I still have issues with squash because the only way I had it as a kid was boiled to a mush with no flavor; if I had sauteed squash with lemon and black pepper over angel hair back then the story would have been much different.",PM_ME_UR_TITHES,2015-01-13 13:42:53
"Thank you. Though, I was going to debate the finer points such as carbs/sugars and calories being insufficient in fruit/veggies (they are not... depending on the fruit/veggies) which is where I assumed this debate would go. (I was preparing myself. :p)

I will concede totally... that a lot of kids DO depend on the school lunch as a primary meal for them. And depriving them of proteins and fats is most likely not the best idea. 

Thank you for the perspective. Instead of an immature tu quoque like the other dude. ",gentlemandinosaur,2015-01-13 13:47:00
"It's *possible* to make a balanced lunch using only fruits and veggies, but it's more difficult and expensive while it has less appeal to children. If the price and taste preferences agreed with kale, papaya, mushrooms, etc., then a fruit and veggie lunch might work out for the kids who just need something to tide them over until they get home.

A low-starch lunch featuring lots of fish, dairy, and legumes might be a better compromise. Imagine how awesome lunches would be if school districts stopped building football stadiums and spent just half that money on sourcing fresh local food products. ",PM_ME_UR_TITHES,2015-01-13 14:03:08
"Legumes are veggies since vegetables is technically only a culinary term.   

But, yes. This is all fair. Like I said I did not consider personal situations of kids and budget restrictions... only from a health and standards viewpoint.

It really baffles me... how crazy people are for their kids and then do not want to spend the taxes and push agendas that benefit them.

Interesting. I wonder whether there are similar conditions working in reverse that make Mars a better place to find [compound zulu] that makes it an interesting place to go there to harvest.

"I don't agree with your opinion. The main difference is that those mass miracles were largely a big sham, whereas this is a true scientific endeavor. 

The scientific community perpetuates itself by doing big projects like this. The scientific data is priceless, sure, but inspiration aspect is immeasurable. 

Think about it this way. The space race inspired a generation of people to go into STEM, and to produce science fiction works like Star Trek, 2001, etc. Those people went on to launch space shuttles and inspire a new generation, while others went on to create things like the cell phone and the internet. Now, a new generation is using those tools and what they learn to put robot trucks on Mars, and have the whole thing streamed on the internet. 

My point is that science and technology progresses exponentialy because of the constant influx of new ideas inspired by the imaginings of young kids who want to make their scientific dreams come true. 

I hope that BronzedNipples goes on into STEM and does something awe-inspiring. Perhaps he will help design the landing mechanism of a manned mission to Mars. Perhaps he will use what he saw today to inspire him to make that landing as safe as possible. Then, the live stream of men walking on Mars will inspire other young BronzedNipples to go into STEM. Or, maybe it will inspire some middle-aged wannabe scifi writer to bring his dreams to life and inspire other young people to make humans livingand working in space a reality. Either way, there's no way to measure the impact big projects like this will mean for the future of STEM. ",,2012-08-06 11:27:18

"This is mostly true, but it implies that a color image is 2 - 3x the size of a grayscale image. When using compression, color images are only modestly larger than grayscale images.

The Curiosity rover *definitely* uses compression - in fact, NASA has even invented custom compression algorithms specifically designed for transmitting as many images as possible over a low-bandwidth connection.

Ping is something like 14 minutes,  though. the problem is that Curiosity transmits to an orbiting satellite that then transmits back to earth, but the satellite isn't always in a position to talk with Curiosity, and since it was in place to watch the descent (snapping pictures in case something went wrong), there are only a few minutes before communication is lost once Curiosity is safely on the ground.

"From a science perspective, the colors that the human eye happens to be able to see are somewhat arbitrary.

The goal of taking pictures on Mars is for the most part not to faithfully reproduce what it would look like if a human was standing there - rather, the goal is to provide as much scientifically valid information as possible.

The Curiosity rover has 17 cameras! Some of the cameras are capable of capturing color images, and you WILL see plenty of true-color images of Mars over the coming days and weeks.

However, some of the cameras are also capable of capturing other wavelengths that the human eye can't normally see - like infrared - because these wavelengths contain lots of useful science data. So in a sense, some of the cameras are *better* than color cameras, they can capture what a human would see and much more.

Finally, many of the cameras are grayscale because color wouldn't help, and it's cheaper and faster to just capture a grayscale picture. Cameras used for only for navigating around obstacles are grayscale, for example.
",dmazzoni,2012-08-06 00:31:19
"Want colour? You need a red, green and blue channel. That means making your sensor 3x bigger, reducing the resolution by 2/3rds, or swapping colour filters (more moving parts). For the hazard avoidance task, colour is an acceptable tradeoff for smaller sensor &amp; greater pixel density. And as pointed out below, bandwidth is *expensive* when shit's coming from Mars. Keep those images as small as possible while retaining usability.",flashman,2012-08-05 23:14:28

"One little thing I wanted to mention... the tears and celebration are so very genuine because long-term projects are *extremely* hard, and result in a different type of stress than most jobs.

I mention this because in my experience many people don't realize this. It's one kind of thing to work retail and get yelled at by a customer, or to be a teacher with an unruly student, or a university student in a difficult or poorly taught class. These things are bad, but are over in a day, week, or semester.

It's another thing to work for years on a single project, where a simple mistake two or three years ago may cost you months of work now, or may cost millions of dollars, or may lead to complete failure of a multi-billion dollar project.

I'm not saying it's better or worse; many people just don't seem to get it. (e.g. ""Oh, you just get to sit at a desk all day playing with computers."")",GoldenShackles,2012-08-06 00:18:11

From that you need to ask yourself what is the solution. Is it ""landing on Mars"" or was it ""to go from 13,000 km/h to 0 km/h in 7 minutes"". Then you start to open you eyes to the *process*.

Too many people convince themselves that the knowledge they have is sufficient to answer questions totally outside our field. Like the Dunning Kruger effect: our ignorance of our ignorance forces us to make experts into dummies who ignore the obvious but in effect we're just showing to ourselves how little we know.

We never allow ourselves to say ""I'm stupid."" and so open our minds to those with the expertise to learn from. It was sad to see how many people thought the landing was a ""stupid idea"" as though they have gone through the other possibilities themselves when in fact all they did was watch a few Transformer movies and deduce everything from that.",the6thReplicant,2012-08-06 01:53:08
"That's the thing, I am an engineer in the space industry, this is my field.  Many of my co-workers have worked at JPL previously.  I might not be an expert, but I know better than most.  I've seen firsthand how easy it is to send a mission to failure.  Systems much less complex and more thoroughly tested than the sky crane fail in the rigors of space.  Hell, just look at the history of mars missions.  Be careful what you say.

I'm trying to imagine where we would be if 50 years ago all the money from sport industry (zippyzappillions of any currency) would be transferred to NASA (or to science sector as it is) and keep flowing like that for these 50 years. I'm trying to imagine this, but I'm failing - because it's beyond imagination. 
Instead, these ""zippyzappillions of any currency"" in last 50 years was used for pure entertainment and didn't progress human race at all. And every year people are convinced that watching how other people run/throw a stick/swim/kick leather bag/*any other sport that is pretty silly when you came to the basis of it* is really important and the best guys from these sports should be earning millions for every achievement they make in their activity - even if it's kicking the leather bag between two sticks.

"When you're working on something like NASA (or really any sort of pure research job) you really aren't money motivated. Paying these guys an extra 100k a year isn't going to get better performance out of them or anything like that. 

Furthermore there is no competing agency that works on the same level that NASA does to help drive the wages up. All you're competing with is private industry (which does nothing on this level) which can offer more money to do less interesting work. The people who will really excel at NASA are those who won't even be tempted by the extra pay at a Google/MS.

So at the end of the day you have people who aren't money motivated working for an agency that has no direct competitors. Do you 

a. increase their wages beyond a level where you are retaining and attracting the right kind of talent.


b. roll the additional money into new research/better equipment/more employees.",TheNicestMonkey,2012-08-06 06:55:03
"You're right that in many cases working at Google or Facebook or Twitter doesn't provide the same thrill as working at JPL.  Many NASA managers would actually love to increase salaries but can't because they're tied to the GS scale.  But, they can't do (b) because the budget is congressionally controlled, and any savings go into other non-NASA projects.  

And, you can argue all day that the people who would really excel won't be tempted by the extra money...but they've still gotta pay their mortgage, buy food, pay for insurance.  And if you're in an area with a large number of private tech companies paying a 50-100% premium over what you make, all of the prices around you are inflated to the point where you need to make significant cuts in your family's standard of living, or move to a location far from work. Imagine you're an engineer at NASA Ames making 80k per year.  How do you afford that $800,000 house in Mountain View?  Well...you could move to San Leandro and commute 90 minutes each way during rush hour.  Or you could answer that call from the Google engineer who's seen the work you've been doing on distributed systems and wants you to join her team with a 100% salary bump.

Paying an extra 100k p/a wouldn't get extra performance from the existing engineers, but it would definitely *keep them around* for more than the 5-10 years it takes for them to realize how badly they're being paid and for their SO to convince them to look elsewhere.

""Oh, I interned at NASA,"" ""Oh I worked at Ames for a couple years,"" ""Yeah I loved my time at Goddard..."" are all common sayings that come out of the mouths of SV engineers.",karthikonaplane,2012-08-06 14:08:40
"It *is* quite low when compared to the Silicon Valley payscale.  There's a reason that Google (and the rest of SV) has been very successful in poaching engineers from NASA.

http://www.opm.gov/oca/12tables/html/la.asp

Note the ""RATES FROZEN AT 2010 LEVELS"" at the top of the page...because of Federal government budget issues, engineers and scientists at JPL (and every other government research lab) have been unable to take part in the salary inflation enjoyed by their peers in private companies.

Hello Congressman/woman ________,


I just finished watching the landing of the Mars rover Curiosity on NASA's live blog and was astounded by the concentration, passion, and genius displayed by NASA's scientists. I know how important events like this are for fostering interest in science and engineering, contributing to our country's burgeoning innovative potential and technological advancement.

"Seriously, I swear I'm the only one who is not understanding the 'heightened' excitement (""We've landed on Mars!!!"", ""I teared up"", etc.). I can appreciate the accomplishment of landing the first autonomous operating laboratory on Mars (an impressive feat) but I feel like a lot of people seem to think this is the first time we've ever landed a rover on Mars. Maybe it's their first experience ever following such an operation (so closely) and feel like they were a part of the team, who I do think have the right to be super emotional and excited since the project represents years of their hard work and are glad it has not failed - yet, fingers crossed.

I followed the Spirit/Opportunity projects when I was a kid as well as the Beagle landings yet I never saw this much happiness and excitement for those projects.

Are people just jumping on what's trending. It really feels like it and just seems to be devaluing the actual accomplishment.

I'll probably get downvoted like crazy for this opinion, but I'd rather appreciate it if instead of pressing the downvote button, individuals actually responded with why they feel this is such a significant event in our history to them as an individual.",crazyjackal,2012-08-06 00:47:42
"Those rovers were nothing compared to this one. This landing was a remarkable feat of engineering that used many new technologies to bring the much more massive payload onto the surface of Mars.

The difficulty was bringing the extreme weight to a halt in little atmosphere. Success means that we might be able to do the same thing with a shuttle.

This landing marks many new advances in aeronautics and systems and controls.

You're right though. A big portion of the heightened excitement is a result of the transparency and media attention they are bringing to the project. This is a good thing. We should be publicizing all of NASA's achievements like this. ",EntrepreneurEngineer,2012-08-06 05:00:43
"Thanks for your reply. That's very interesting to hear about the payload. I looked up the factual numbers to get an idea exactly how much bigger it was. 

&gt;Curiosity is about twice as long and five times as massive as the Spirit and Opportunity Mars exploration rovers, and carries over ten times the mass of scientific instruments. It successfully carried out a more accurate landing than previous rovers, within a landing ellipse of 7 by 20 km (4.3 by 12 mi), in the Aeolis Palus region of Gale Crater. This location is near the mountain Aeolis Mons (a.k.a. ""Mount Sharp""). It is designed to explore for at least 687 Earth days (1 Martian year) over a range of 5 by 20 km (3.1 by 12 mi).

Indeed the landing marks a step in the right direction to sending a manned mission to another planetary body one day (hopefully).",crazyjackal,2012-08-06 08:06:26

"Totally agree. I just commented to a guy that would be a perfect response to you. I said to him. ""People are so excited about this today like we havent been sending rovers to mars since the 1970's, tommorow there will be a cat at the top of reddit and people will be concerned with what new show is on tv that exploits people and space exploration with be in the back of everyones minds and space programs with STILL be 1000000000000% UNDERFUNDED."" People think that my comment is bashing this latest rover and its not. My comment is simply saying that if we keep on being content with sending rovers to mars we will never experiance the true meaning of space exploration. People are so concerned about sending people into space without knowing 100% whats going to happen. Exploration is about not knowing, going to the unknown. Many people on this planet would gladly go on a mission to mars/whereever with a 0% return rate. There are actual people out there that want to do more than we are doing people that will give their life to see what hasnt been seen. But when people have the attention span of 12 year old on the internet we will just be content with doing the same old thing over and over. Like i said our defense budget has NEVER done anything to advance us as a people. Space exploration in every sense is the meaning of advancing us as a people.

"[Is a manned trip to Mars and back possible very soon?](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980419b.html)

&gt; It's a two year round trip to Mars by a direct minimum energy orbit each direction, with a few month's wait at Mars as well. The current world record for the longest duration in space is about half that time and there are serious medical problems the Russian cosmonauts have encountered when they return to Earth (American astronauts have only very recently started long stays in space on the Mir space station and the current record of six months set by Shannon Lucid last year: see http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/news/28oct96.html). The medical problems of returning to Earth will require solutions which research with Mir and the International Space Station might shed light on.

[Flight to Mars: the Return Trip](http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smars3.htm)

&gt; Just one: a very stringent requirement on the relative positions of Earth and Mars at the time of launch. As will be seen, the required conditions occur only once in about 26 months. For flying back from Mars to Earth the Hohmann ellipse can also be used, but again, the planets need to be positioned just right at the time of launch. If astronauts from Earth ever land on Mars, they must choose between waiting over one year for the right conditions to occur, or else taking a more direct but less economical ride home.",tommles,2012-08-05 23:03:46

This is isn't nearly as powerful as images of the first manned landing on the moon.  That was a man. This is an R/C car. The moon landing was broadcast live on the radio and TV commentators followed it on national broadcast channels, not streamed in a 2.5"" x 2.5"" window on a laptop.  The moon landing happened in the mid-afternoon (in the USA), so lots of people were getting the news of it's success at the same time, as opposed to tonight's 1:30am EST landing.

On the other hand, the other bodies I listed, especially Enceladus and Europa, could have life now. 

Anyway, I don't really have an opinion myself because I don't know much and was simply pointing out that many planetary scientists are rather annoyed at how much funding Mars is getting.

Furthermore, how far life is on either Enceladus or Europa is questionable, since those scratches are thought to be zones where water from underneath emerged and Enceladus even has geysers. 

Anyway, we're not searching for life on Mars with Curiosity. Mars is all tapped out in terms of searching for life with rovers for the moment, it's only searching ""how hard would it have been to have life here"" (habitability). ",tsk05,2012-08-05 23:34:30

"Volunteer at a library, volunteer at juvey, read to kids, donate books, donate time and resources to charities helping kids get educations. Maybe even foster or adopt kids, and if you have your own bring them up to value this kind of thing. Maybe learn to draw and draw stuff like the Zen Pencils guy does. (You can speak eloquently so you can probably get the writing part down. At my estimation it'll take about 7 years to be a truly competent cartoonist, unless you're 85 you can manage it if you're determined - pick up Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain - or just make XKCD stick figures if you want. Or write a YA book, you don't have to draw anything at all.) 

I dropped out when I was thirteen - got molested, went insane for a couple years, nobody wanted to deal with it, brain is fried now from trauma, etc. etc. etc. - I was a precocious little shit, IQ through the roof, helped my friend build a Tesla coil in his basement. I had wanted to be a scientist like this. I know I'm not going to get anywhere near a place like CalTech or NASA now and I've come to terms with that, but I have very fond memories of the spirit I had when I was a child. So I understand where you're coming from. From my perspective, I think enkindling that spirit in others and protecting it is the greatest thing you can do for anyone.

I'm good at cloud computing and stuff and there was a lot of openings for their cloud computing platform.  I already volunteer at schools, I manage some lego robotics teams and high school FIRST teams.

We're talking about a tiny point of light in the vastness of space here. No, we didn't just stop at ""let us hit this point"", no we pin-pointed this tiny little microscopic dot on this one pixel of light and said ""THAT DITCH RIGHT THERE is where we want this robot to go"". 

Millions of miles later, the roman candle fired off a capsule into the atmosphere, where it performed a procedure which would be considered ridiculously complicated if it was done right here on Earth. Again, MILLIONS of miles away, the robot landed itself on an alien planet without burning up or smashing itself into itsy bitsy little pieces. There it proceeds to take pictures and send them back to Earth. 

All of this made possible because of a teeny glitch in the Universe that caused hyrdogen to pack itself denser than it should have.",harmless-mostly,2012-08-05 23:13:25

"That's what I don't get... there's already a rover on Mars, what's the significance of Curiosity? ",,2012-08-06 01:15:14
"There's tons of reasons Curiosity is significant, but I can give one of the biggest ones:

Previous mars rovers (spirit/opprotunity): 408lbs - including solar panels. Ran off solar power = slow and minimal travel possible only part of the year when sunlight was reasonably plentiful. Size = got hung up in sand etc and couldn't just drive all willy-nilly around the planet. 

Curiosity = 2,000 lbs. How big is that? Well those classic VW beetles you see rolling around here on earth have a curb weight of roughly 2,000 lbs. That's -BIG-. Hell, remember that lunar rover you can watch astronauts driving around on the moon in? That was only 460 lbs. Curiosity runs off nuclear power (an RTG) that will be producing 100-125 watts of electricity plus over 2000 watts of heat (to keep it nice and toasty) for the next -14- years, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Not relying on solar arrays and batteries means most of that 2,000lbs is pure science. It's a beast of a rover, able to roll over large obstacles and almost impossible to bog down. It's loaded with a pile of amazing instruments and awesome camera gear that would make any scientist envious and it's ready to deliver those instruments to mile upon mile of the martian surface.

Here, look at this picture:
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=112382895478361&amp;set=a.112376352145682.5722.110938085622842&amp;type=3&amp;theater

Yeah, curiosity is BIG. It has science instruments that are individually bigger than whole previous rovers :).

To say this rover is significant is seriously undervaluing it's capabilities. Previous rovers were kids toys compared to this beast. This rover, more than any other, is going to tell us if mars harbors or harbored life. It's going to give us eyes on the ground unlike anything we've ever had before. It's going to record conditions at ground level (such as radiation exposure) to see if humans could acceptably live there. It's the most advanced and technologically capable piece of space exploration robotics ever created. 

Damn if I'm not excited to see what it turns up :).",,2012-08-06 07:47:54
TIL I want the Sojourner rover as a pet.,kayamon,2012-08-06 11:11:52
"Is there any solar support at all? Spirit lasted 20 times longer than they thought because of solar power -- I understand this is a much different machine, but it'd be neat if it could squeeze out some more time past the 14 years.

I was so sad when Spirit stopped responding. I think NASA had a twitter account for it, and the tweet was so ... sad. ",big_onion,2012-08-06 08:23:05
"They only intend to run this thing for a couple of years. My point with the 14 year span is that over 14 years it's only going to lose a few watts of power generation - enough to keep the whole rover rolling for years after that if they were so inclined. It's completely within the realm of possibility that this rover could be cruising around 20 years from now. If it helps you understand the kind of lifespans we're dealing with here - voyager 1 and 2 are still sending back data to the earth from the outside edge of our solar system, powered by this sort of device.

Of course, the hope is we'll be pretty swiftly approaching a human mars mission by that point, rendering the old MSL unnecessary. I'd expect this rover will continue soldering around mars well past it's 2 year mark at any rate. We'll probably be driving it around a decade from now and that is quite impressive. It'll easily travel further and do more than all of our previous rovers on mars combined. Wonderful stuff.",,2012-08-06 09:06:28
"That's awesome. I love that the Voyagers are still out there doing their thing. I didn't realize it was the same power source.

Do you think that the success of the sky crane means they'll make use of it in future missions? I kind of picture this being a great way to put humans on the planet -- no giant impact or anything. And if they can somehow make the sky crane itself a source of parts for establishing a habitat, even better. I think space exploration involves a lot of waste (space junk), so it'd be neat to see them come up with a ""everything is useful"" approach.

It makes me giddy to think we'll see men on Mars in my lifetime.",big_onion,2012-08-06 11:32:02
"I imagine a different system will be used to drop humans. The capsule was still subjected to some remarkable g-forces as it decelerated through the atmosphere. You don't want to be hitting astronauts with sustained 11G+ deceleration if you're looking to get their fleshy meatbags to the ground safely.

That said, landing humans on another planet is reasonably baked - it just takes a large craft and plenty of rocket fuel. As far as I can tell the sky crane was used more to meet the payload needs of this mission than anything else. They needed a system that could land this huge rover with a minimum amount of propellant. A lightweight supersonic chute and some pyrotechnics fit the bill without needing a four ton descent module :). If and when we get around to sending humans, we'll undoubtely be packing enough tonnage that we can handle a nice soft landing without any sky crane silliness.

Also, if you're seriously curious how we'll likely send humans and explore mars, this little talk is probably a damn good primer:

"Is... is that what I think it is?

Edit: Turns out it's a panorama from Spirit. It's not from Curiosity. [This is the source.](http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/panoramas/spirit/2005.html) There's still a lot of awesome photos of Mars on that link. It might be fun to look at given the current circumstances.

Here's the information about this particular picture&amp;mdash;for those too lazy to look at the link:  (Like I normally would be.)  
  
In late November 2005 while descending ""Husband Hill,"" NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit took the most detailed panorama so far of the ""Inner Basin,"" the rover's next target destination. Spirit acquired the 405 individual images that make up this 360-degree view of the surrounding terrain using five different filters on the panoramic camera. The rover took the images on Martian days, or sols, 672 to 677 (Nov. 23 to 28, 2005 -- the Thanksgiving holiday weekend). 

This image is an approximately true-color rendering using camera's 750-, 530-, and 430-nanometer filters. Seams between individual frames have been eliminated from the sky portion of the mosaic to better simulate the vista a person standing on Mars would see. 

""Home Plate,"" a bright, semi-circular feature scientists hope to investigate, is harder to discern in this image than in earlier views taken from higher up the hill. Spirit acquired this more oblique view, known as the ""Seminole panorama,"" from about halfway down the south flank of Husband Hill, 50 meters (164 feet) or so below the summit. Near the center of the panorama, on the horizon, are ""McCool Hill"" and ""Ramon Hill,"" named, like Husband Hill, in honor of the fallen astronauts of the space shuttle Columbia. Husband Hill is visible behind the rover, on the right and left sides of the panorama. An arc of rover tracks made while avoiding obstacles and getting into position to examine rock outcrops can be traced over a long distance by zooming in to explore the panorama in greater detail. 

Spirit is now significantly farther downhill toward the center of this panorama, en route to Home Plate and other enigmatic soils and outcrop rocks in the quest to uncover the history of Gusev Crater and the ""Columbia Hills."" ",atlas_again,2012-08-05 23:50:51

The first two Mars rovers are, I think, 70kg each? Curiosity is 900kg. It has an entire chemistry lab on board, and more instruments and cameras than anything ever put on another planet.

Spirit and Opportunity used solar panels that meant they had to shut down in the winter due to lack of sunlight, and everyone would hope they would eventually wake themselves up when the sun came back out in spring. Curiosity is nuclear powered, letting it run constantly until its batteries die in a couple years.

It's got goddamned [car tire-sized wheels](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/H_rover-comp_wheels_02.jpg/800px-H_rover-comp_wheels_02.jpg) (the very first Mars rover is on the left, Spirit/Opportunity center, Curiosity right) that will keep it from suffering Spirit's fate, when she got stuck in the dirt and couldn't turn towards the sun to keep her power up, until she simply powered down forever.

It put a lot of new technology to a very expensive test (off the top of my head, that goddamned terrifying rocket-propelled sky crane) and did it flawlessly.

It shows people NASA still knows what they're doing.",Tokeli,2012-08-05 23:12:33
"&gt;The first two Mars rovers are, I think, 70kg each? Curiosity is 900kg.

Holy fuck, that in itself puts it in to perspective nicely.

&gt; Curiosity is nuclear powered, letting it run constantly until its batteries die in a couple years.

What happens then? Do they just leave it?

&gt;she got stuck in the dirt and couldn't turn towards the sun to keep her power up, until she simply powered down forever.

Is it possible to recover her? Is there any *use* in recovering her?

Also, I wish I had know some of this stuff before watching the stream. I would have been more emotionally involved.",LORDJEW_VAN_CUNTFUCK,2012-08-05 23:21:39
"NASA tried for about a year to get Spirit un-stuck, but nothing worked (they spent most of that time doing simulations on Earth to try and figure it out), so they simply did science in place until the batteries drained. Past a certain point, the rover doesn't have enough power to keep its electronics warm enough to stay operating (Mars winters are -50C around where the rovers were, or lower), and it just shuts down for good.

The rovers are all there to stay, and I like to think they'll stay there forever, exactly wherever fate decides to let them die. Build museums around them, in a couple hundred years. At the very least they'll be a testament to humankind for a long time if we never go to Mars, until they erode away to nothing.",Tokeli,2012-08-06 00:26:45

I mean, there are many parts in Curiosity also from other countries, the team that worked in it is surely also composed of people from other nations.

When they talk about ""our"" mission or ""our"" Curiosity, shouldn't it be the mission of us humans and the curiosity of us humans rather than Americas mission and Americas Curiosity?

"Well its a lot more advanced.  Also just the sheer difficulty and exact coordination with all of the systems used to make it land successfully were just utterly stunning.  i don't know if you watched the simulation but it used a re-entry pod, followed by a parachute and ejecting the heat shield, then it had to release the chute and use thrusters to slow the descent, and then had to use a crane to lower the rover below the thrusters to avoid kicking up dust,  after which the thruster pod had to detach and fly away somewhere else.

The size also makes the balloon-airbag descent of the smaller rovers unfeasible, so they had to devise a really mind-blowing powered flight descent that involved parachutes, multiple stages, rockets, hovering, a sky-crane cable-drop and more.

Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".

"I'll hazard an explanation from what I understand of it, but I could be mistaken.

They wanted an image taken right after the landing and sent to Earth. Bandwidth and time is a big problem as the Odyssey orbiter that would relay the signal would be losing line of sight minutes after the touchdown. This means they needed the smallest amount of data to be sent to increase the odds that there would be time for it to get through before the rover lost the orbiter. Also the main camera mast was still stowed, so it's cameras couldn't be used. The only cameras left to them were the ones used by the piloting crew to help ID obstacles around the rover. These are low res cameras meant for navigation and not science. So that is what they used. It was a quick and nasty transmission using the lowest res possible using an relay satellite that they could only see for a few minutes.",Mercedes383,2012-08-06 06:11:49
"Because Odyssey could only communicate with it for a couple of minutes before it went over the horizon and lost communication.

These were just small simple snapshots with the lens safety covers still attached to prevent damage to the lens.  This was just to simply verify it was there and safe.

I read somewhere that they have video from the underside of the lander while the rover was being lowered.  They just have to get it transferred back to us here.

I have no information as to how often Odyssey will pass over the rover or anything like that.  We'll get plenty more in time, but for now we are happy because we know it's there and safe.",,2012-08-06 06:14:20

"The images were only from the hazard cameras (used for hazard avoidance and navigation) and they have dust caps on them for the landing.  The dust caps will come off and those pictures will be better.  The rover has 17 (or 12, can't quite remember) cameras in total.  They just aren't deployed yet.",seymour47,2012-08-06 10:30:13
"Basically, from what I gather from my reading. They have limited windows when data can be transmitted, i.e. a satellite needs to have line of site to communicate with Curiosity. So, Curiosity buffers, or stores all of it's landing, telemetry information, pictures, self test results, data from all it's sensors, on and on. Then when it gets a chance, it packages this stuff up and transmits those packets at a certain rate, to the satellite and then back to earth. 

The reason those first pictures were so small was that there was an immense amount of status information, so they used the on-board computer to pre-compress the pictures down in data size so that they would fit in that window (transfer speed bits/s and satellite transit time) along with all that status information. 

There are much higher resolution images still stored in the computer on the rover, but that have to get that important status information off it first, make sure everything is running okay after the landing. ",melignus,2012-08-06 10:48:57

"Aside from the larger size, wealth of new sensors and ridiculously difficult [new landing procedure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s), this is the rover that was needed to get us to the next step: manned Mars missions.

&gt; Unlike Sojourner, Spirit, or Opportunity, Curiosityâs mission is explicitly designed to gather important data prior to a future manned mission to Mars.

"I'll throw the science junk aside and give you things the common person can understand.

In order to land people on a distant ""rock"" they require a whole lot more than a robot.  They need a whole lot of life support systems (O2 and CO2 filters), food, and depending on the length of the mission a suitable habitat.  The big thing involved in all of those is even a meal for one person has weight.

When you [look at the rovers](http://www.redorbit.com/media/uploads/2012/08/616901main_rover_comparison1600_946-710-617x416.jpg) over the years, you see they have increased in size massively.  This presents a couple challenges.

1)  Mars has half the atmosphere of Earth.  This means you have to accommodate for it's friction (heat shields) and the fact that a wrong entry angle will bounce you right off the atmosphere.  But, Mars' atmosphere is too thin to be helpful.  When landing on Earth you throw up a parachute and our nice atmosphere slows you down to survivable speeds... on Mars you become a pile of broken parts in a crater.  Because of the rover's weight pushing the probe to a bad angle, and the unknown environment at the time (the atmosphere could be thick or thin depending on the weather or season) Curosity's entry probe had a line of jets to realign it to stay on track for hitting Mt. Sharp's base.  

2)  Curiosity is length of a small car and weighs almost a ton.  Landing each vehicle has presented new challenges.  The previous rover, for instance, landed inside a mass of giant balls and rolled to a stop.  [Curiosity had a far better landing system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47JanXuYlNo), and one that can be better replicated for larger rovers instead of ""throwing it at the planet"".

Curiosity also has [a far better power planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator).  Previous rovers were all solar powered, and had a lifespan of ~90 days give or take a lot depending on the weather and amount of sand in the air.  Rovers don't move fast, so dust will settle on the panels.  NASA has been fortunate in windstorms blowing the dust off, but sand is corrosive in nature and will eventually scratch the panels beyond repair.  Curiosity doesn't care, it runs on nuclear power so has a ""power life-span"" of over two years.  The key to curiosity will be how long it's inner components can survive the elements.

Everything they learned on this mission will again be upscaled to a larger rover.  One possibly capable of carrying human cargo.  They still have a few things to sort out, I don't think any rover has entered at ""survivable"" g-forces, and there is the matter of a Mars landing not being a suicide mission.  

Europeans sailed across the ocean not knowing what they would find when they went over the horizon.  We have people living in unforgivable conditions in Antarctica and the North Pole, we've built biodomes in the hottest deserts.  To ask why send people to a lifeless rock ignores the fact that as human beings we have an instinctive desire to push ourselves to the limits of survivability to see what we are capable of.",balorina,2012-08-06 20:37:55

As the trillions of dollars under the control of the Fed and big money families like the Rothschilds have proven time and again, no amount of money can fix the human condition. Especially not the paltry few billion given to NASA. Money spent on geopolitics and wars will never elevate mankind to the high frontier. 

Next time you want to say ""space is a waste of money"" I take a look at the billions people spend getting politicians elected and say that THAT is a waste of money. Space Exploration inspires Engineering innovation. Obama or Romney's campaign chest inspires nothing. Spending billions on Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan. Propping up failed banks with bail outs, wasting trillions of dollars that could put into place a Spacebased Power Station and provide free electricity to the entire country or begin terraforming Mars &amp; Venus and unite humanity in the greatest engineering feats of all history to construct orbiting space colonies to reduce the burden on our ever growing population. Instead, we must spend money propping up failed Churches and failed religions like Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and the rest. We waste billions financing Israel when we should be financing America's space program instead.

Inspiring people to elevate the national discussion towards matters of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, can however, take the minds of humanity out of the gutter of hateful party politics. 

I pray for the day that the Politicians are removed from our Government and replaced with Scientists, Architects, and Engineers.

The founding generation were wise enough to elect as their representatives real men of genius. Men like Jefferson, Franklin, and Washington who's IQ I dare say rivaled those of Newton, Hawking, and Einstein.

"It seems that inquisitiveness is down-voted by some.  Unfortunately, I am in no way qualified or capable of providing a satisfactory explanation.  This vehicle is much larger (1 ton) and is vastly more capable (research and collection-wise) than the previous rovers.  I think we have a more specific set of tasks for it to perform as well, rather than just simply looking around and collecting soil samples (though I understand that it will be doing that as well).

Despite the event, 90% of Americans will continue to profess a faith in a divine creator and over 50% will continue to believe the account of Genesis.  

Oh, and NASA's funding will still be cut.

"Word.  It seems to me that NASA should probably spend some of their paltry budget on a PR department that actually uses these historic (I genuinely feel that I witnessed something INCREDIBLE last night) events to INSPIRE some of those who seem to have forgotten why this is so special.  Several people tried to tell me that last night was our generation's moon-landing.  Well, the technical achievement and the potential for expanding our knowledge is similar, but they failed to (god, I can't believe I am about to say this...) market the event.  Ugh, I feel dirty after saying that.  ",chuang-tzu,2012-08-06 06:59:46

"They could market it all they like, the fact is the interest just wouldn't be there.

More people these days are happier to spend their non-working or non-school time posting shit on facebook to one another and crediting everything to a non-existent deity than they are reading and thinking about the world we live in. 

Then one also has to wonder what would have happened. Look at how the US tv networks have handled the olympics. I would hate to think of what today's network executives would do to such a beautiful spectacle if they got their hands on it. ",,2012-08-06 08:05:52

I am a pre-service secondary Social Studies, U.S./World History, and Government teacher (read: I am just about to start my semester of student teaching).  Having been through the education program here at Boise State I can safely say that there is a staggering lack of imagination in the realm of Math and Science education.  I fell in love with my subjects because I had GREAT public school educators who made it relevant and engaging.  I know there are math/science teachers out there who are already doing this, but I would like to see a systemic shift toward making it more about 'fun' (for lack of a better term) and problem-based exploration, and less about test scores and AYP.  I think the latter will follow the former if we do it right.  Though, as you rightly point out, apathy and laziness are widespread.  There will always be a percentage of students who just don't give a rip.   ",chuang-tzu,2012-08-06 09:31:29

This mission to mars isn't going to give us a cure for cancer or clean renewable energy.  It won't give us the next iDevice or 4D TV, nor will it make athletes faster or breasts larger.

It is the exploration, discovery, and pure research that is required in science that is the main goal.  To confirm our current knowledge of Mars, to confirm our suspicions of its past, and to learn new things about its history and environment.  The possibilities are truly limitless.

Most people involved are hoping to learn specifically about the ""warm and wet"" phase of the planet's development, and perform geological tests that may reveal data about organic and inorganic chemicals that may be present.  This could reveal past life, current life, or the possibility of future life on Mars.

If you're looking for an invention that comes directly from the MSL's research, you're probably out of luck.  It wasn't made to find weapons or technology.  Just to learn.",simjanes2k,2012-08-06 02:27:52

How were they getting the data back so quickly.  It seemed that they knew what was going on real time despite the aforementioned 7 minute delay,anthrocide,2012-08-05 23:55:44
"The ""real time"" was delayed by 7 minutes. In the livestream they said ""At this point, we know the rover is on Mars, but we don't know the condition it's in"" about 7 minutes before the confirmed touchdown. Still amazing how quickly they got the pictures though.",duckington,2012-08-05 23:59:00
So how did they know at the estimated landing time of 1:31 AM EDT that the rover successfully landed?  Did the thing really touch down on Mars at 1:26 AM EDT?,anthrocide,2012-08-06 00:05:05
"They have received telemetry data. They were just waiting for that data as if it was live, although everything has happened seven minutes before.",Rarehero,2012-08-06 00:30:16
"1:31 AM EDT was the time news of the landing was expected to be received on earth, taking into account the time delay.

Everything went according to plan, so that's exactly when the announcement happened. But the rover actually landed on Mars nearly 14 minutes earlier.

(I'm not sure where everyone got 7 minutes. The delay is close to 14 minutes, not 7.)
",dmazzoni,2012-08-06 01:21:25
14 minutes is round trip.  From Mars to Earth is 7 minutes-that's why they called it the 7 minutes of terror. ,anthrocide,2012-08-06 09:35:18
"From Mars to Earth is currently approximately 154 million miles, and if you divide that by the speed of light you get [13.8 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=154+million+miles+%2F+speed+of+light) - that's the one-way time.

The distance varies a lot. When Mars is at its closest point to Earth, it's only ~56 million km away - around 3 minutes one-way. At its farthest, it's 400 million km, or about 22 minutes one-way.

Seven minutes of terror refers to the time from when the spacecraft enters the Martian atmosphere to when it lands on the surface. There's no relation between 7 minutes and 13.8 minutes other than the fact that because 7 &lt; 13.8, the whole thing was over before we even got any information about it hitting the atmosphere. If it had been possible to take a leisurely 45 minute landing, for example, it would have been theoretically possible to examine the first 5 minutes of the entry and send some commands to compensate during the final approach. But because the landing time was much shorter than the light delay, that was impossible.

You can verify this at just about any source:

"Every piece of info they got, the cutoffs, heartbeats, pics and all are all delayed. Its realtime displaced by 7 mins. Similar to the TV delay of live events. There wasn't going to be info, then 7 mins of silence and waiting, its just all askewed.",suchaherosandwich,2012-08-06 00:00:26

NASA is entirely separate funding from Military. JPL, the center that built Curiosity, is a federally-funded research and development center that's run by Caltech (a private university) and under contract with NASA to lead robotic exploration of our planet and our solar system.

Occasionally some work at JPL gets funded by DOD grants, especially DARPA - but that's usually because some group at JPL created some technology that also happens to have military applications. But other than that, JPL has pretty much nothing in common with ""the military-industrial complex"".

I don't understand how that's relevant. By that argument, any research or development that *might* have military applications is therefore supporting the military-industrial complex. That's silly.

The fact is that NASA is not part of the military-industrial complex. The work NASA does is peaceful and virtually all of it is unclassified and shared with the general public.

"OK, a couple of things to think about here:

We are talking about a handful of things on the surface of a *planet*.  Even if we put a thousand such things on the planet, the environmental impact would be insignificant.  

Secondly, we barely have the technology to even put things on Mars right now.  I think the success rate up to this point has been around 30%.  I'm fairly certain no one is designing missions to go collect up the missions.  

All of these probes will likely sit abandoned for hundreds of years before anyone ever sees them again.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NASA_missions#Interplanetary_missions

If, several hundreds of years from now, people ever actually lay eyes on them, they will probably (hopefully) turn the sites into the equivalent of national landmarks or parks with the probes and related equipment being cordoned off as museum artifacts.  Or maybe someone will get there and claim them and sell them to private collectors.  ",farkdog,2012-08-06 09:12:48

You don't send men and women to Mars without knowing 100% (or 99.99% i guess) what you're going to do when you get there, and what kind of problems you might face when you get there.

Don't forget the distances involved here. Right now, with current technology it takes, I think, about three months to get to Mars. It's not at all like going to the moon. You can't just turn yourself around and get back  at the snap of your fingers. Something goes wrong and you are almost completely fucked.

Mars is SO much more difficult than anything we've ever encountered, when it comes to getting there, landing, taking off, and getting back. It took HUGE amounts of technical skill to land this 2000lb rover (its the size of a mini-cooper) on the surface. We landed it with a FUCKING SKY CRANE. It took 8 YEARS to plan and implement this mission. Don't underestimate how difficult all of this was.  

Edit: But obviously I agree with you in regard to the budget. Hopefully these rovers will garner support for a larger percentage of our spending.",foofaw,2012-08-06 00:09:58
"Mike Massimino nasa astronaut said if they had a manned mission to mars with a zero percent return rate he would gladly go. (so would I and many other people in the world) I  have to disagree with you about about the knowing 100% (99.99%) in order to explore. THE WHOLE POINT of exploration is to find the unknown. If we are going to base our future space exploration on our knowledge of space then WE WILL NEVER GO ANYWHERE. There are alot of people in the world that would go on a one way mission or a mission with a really low return percentage. Not trying to be rude but that mindset of not sending men and women into space without knowing (insert reasoning here) is the reason we have not done anything new in space exploration. We have been sending rovers to mars since the 70's what else have we done in space since then? NOTHING. Like I said there are alot of people out there like me that would give our life for the future of space exploration. Sadly im not in the running for any space programs lol.The point of my comment is that everyone is so excited about this today like we have never done this before. Tomorrow everyone will forget and space exploration will be on the back burner again and everyone will be more concerned with what cat is getting karma or whats the new best show to exploit people on tv, and while that is going on space exploration will still be underfunded and making little to no progress. 

I know doing anything in space is hard and i know this new rover landing was hard, but how will we ever progress if we just keep doing the same thing over and over again. You can disagree that this rover is differnt but the concept is the same. We sent another rover to mars. The way we did it might be new the camra might be new EVERYTHING might be new but the concept is the same. Rover landings are not the future.

Ive done my research guy. You obviously are missing the point of my comment. Please tell me how we are getting humans to mars in 2030's when we have made no steps in making any new advancements in putting humans in space. Are you telling me this rover collecting mineral data and taking photos is going to help us with the knowledge and tech of how to get a human to and from mars and with what spacecraft are they going to use because as far as I know (but I dont research) We havent had any new leaps in spacecraft engineering anytime that ive seen. Maybe you can enlighten me with the project where we are not still using the same outdated tech we used in the 1960's?(no im not talking about inner orbit Virgin galactic type of projects) Ill be waiting. Oh also maybe you didnt do your research but the point of curiosity is to look for the ingredients of life. NOT how to get people to mars. ,EXCOM,2012-08-06 01:14:13
"As to why I doubt you've done research please read my other comment.

Again, you use an extreme ""no steps in making any new advancements in putting humans in space"". Clearly wrong. Google it. 

**1) Advancements in [radiation research](http://www.pvamu.edu/pages/2715.asp)**

This is extremely important and is a significant challenge opposing long flights in space. It would take over half a year to get to Mars. Also Mars does not have the electromagnetic field needed to block harmful radiation. 

**2) Advances in [medicine](http://gizmodo.com/5882725/the-miraculous-nasa-breakthrough-that-could-save-millions-of-lives)**

Note the title of the article is **The Miraculous NASA Breakthrough that Could Save Millions of Lives**. This is important for traveling and living on a planet where medical resources are extremely limited. In addition, this has real world applications as the article points out.

**3) Research and several solutions on how to simulate gravity during a long space flight.**

This one I saw in a movie recently and I'm tired of googling articles for you so I'm just going to tell you about it. Lack of gravity causes bone loss and muscle loss over long periods of time. In addition this can lower your immune system.  Two solutions are: rotate the space ship to simulate gravity, or much simpler, rotating *beds* that simulate gravity.


As for new work being done on the spacecraft. Satellite delivery has become much more efficient as well as trips to the international space station. SpaceX has been ramping up and we should see many new things from them in the near future. NASA is working on this too. [Orion Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Multi-Purpose_Crew_Vehicle)

Curiosity has multiple purposes, one of which, yes (wow, you got something right), is to ascertain whether or not Mars was ever able to support life. Another purpose is to determine whether or not Mars has the materials needed to support a permanent station.

Why a permanent station? We can't exactly fly down a fuel to the planet can we. Mars has much higher gravity than the moon, and once we land, we need a heavy lift vehicle to leave again. Any human that lands on Mars will be there quite some time. We need to know the makeup of the planet before that happens, otherwise, the mission will be a sad one. Perhaps NASA wants to know if the soil could be made suitable for plant life? 


&gt;Ive done my research guy

Please take the above examples (more than 3) as reasons why I doubt you have done your research. Also, I'm not your guy, dude.

Also not to sound like a huge prick if i dont already but with zero to no funding coming in for space exploration and zero to no progression when it comes to humans in space. The date of 2030 is highly unlikely. The government can say hey sure we give you the go to want to go to mars in 2030. That might sound nice. But how do we do that with no funding or tech? Really im curious.,EXCOM,2012-08-06 01:26:12
"There has been much progression recently and many technological advances recently in space, especially when taking into consideration.

In fact funding has stayed about the same (or increased) since the mid 1970's *even after adjusting for inflation*. Its true that percentage of the budget NASA used to hold was extremely high at the end of the 1960's but that was a time when they were pushing the lunar landings. I'd bet you anything it happens again when its time for a human presence on Mars.

Your argument is absolutely baseless. This would be obvious to someone, like you, who doesn't even know the subject matter. This is obvious because you use extremes such as ""zero to no progression"" or ""no funding or tech"". These are obviously untrue. An easy google search will satisfy your *curiosity* if you are really so curious.

I agree that [NASA's budget](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=nasa+budget) is  way smaller than it should be; however, you are arguing like an idiot and its hard to take your side.

Another domain in which leaps and bounds are being made  in space lies within the private space industry. Several [civilian companies](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=private+companies+in+space) have already appeared and taken over some of NASA's previous roles. Not only that, but they are making a profit. Some even are estimated to make trillions if everything goes according to plan.

Finally, its easy not to ""be a stick in the mud"" or ""sound like a huge prick"" when making an argument.

Let you in on a little secret. This has always been the case for pretty much every year in human history. Never has the future actually looked rosy. Yes, we're still here. It's always tempting to take the easiest path and assume the worst for the future (actually not a bad assumption when it comes to planning for stuff).

That's the amusing reason why humanity hasn't killed itself yet. Because, for the dumbfuck bravado the war hawks of the world try to show when they wave their dicks in the wind, in the end, they wanna live to see another day and those that don't tend to reach a grisly end (sometimes even at the hands of their own people). 

When it truly matters, the parasites tend to get chewed up first because they can rarely take the strain. What's left is usually a much stronger version of humanity.

Maybe you should be riding the ass of the people who are actually responsible for solving those problems instead of throwing a dart at the budget and finding the smallest random thing to rant at.",thrawnie,2012-08-06 00:17:59

If a spawn of the dreaded cold war military-industrial complex can turn into what NASA is today (and at the criminally low levels of funding it has to operate on) and be capable of such amazing feats as the one we've seen today, what might we collectively accomplish when we *really* put our minds and money and effort where it counts? Already, science has lobbying power in the US. Already, the military is no longer the only path into space. Already, private space travel is becoming reality. 

Think about *that* and be blown away by the possibilities. 

Further, scientific progress has always been the realm of a tiny minority of humanity. The rest can plug along doing what they want. It doesn't matter. The few can handle it. That, more than anything else is what keeps the hope alive for me - it takes only a few.",thrawnie,2012-08-06 01:01:07

Then I read that it took fungus 50 million years to evolve its ability to decompose matter and then that a panel of scientists say that ecological collapse is eminent.

Why are we not cherishing and protecting this long suffering planet that might as well be the only place with life.

You could see a few people hard at work amidst the observers.  Could NASA have saved money for future missions last night by not having so many people at work with no apparent task?

I can't believe the answer is no.  It reminds me of the Las Vegas junket for thousands of GSA staff.  Would an independent journalist please look into this public policy issue?

When you buy insurance you aren't paying for the potential loss out of pocket, nor can you apply for a policy during, say, a car accident. When you buy insurance you are paying for something that, if all goes well, does absolutely nothing for you. That doesn't make it an unwise expenditure.

Likewise, a room full of engineers ""watching tv"" is much cheaper, in the sense of expected ROI, than not having them. 

Similarly, you hire firefighters to be ready for when a fire starts; you don't wait until the forest is burning. If there's no fire it doesn't mean you don't need to pay them.",Metaheuristic,2012-08-06 13:03:11

I am also aware, from own experience, that high functioning positions do not require a steady time-in-motion type of activity.  Intellectual contributions are very valuable and unique.  So jump into one of your figurative sandbags and eat sand.  

I also know about insurance.  And no insurance company has 500 agents standing by, waiting for the calls to come in, just in case.

And I am also a sharp observer who has worked in such situations as that control room last night.  A few people were engaged and working.  The vast majority appeared very distracted and had to struggle to pay attention as we got down to the final moments.    

The decision to allow so many people to hang around while live TV was watching was wrong and it shows why so many are troubled by the NASA mentality.  If anything, that TV shot will boost private space activity and the idea of real-world cost controls.

"I get the science behind it, and it's not the excitement aspect that is of putting to me, it just seems like they are just kinda thanking each other, and not giving any details about the actual landing. ",designerdy,2012-08-06 00:07:19

"Europe and Russia have NOT done this many times. The US is the only country to have landed a functioning robot on Mars. Other countries have tried but they failed. We succeeded and we've done it multiple times now. Today marks the fourth successful landing of a rover on Mars by the US. 

And we're less advanced than Canada? Funny, the US is ranked as the most technologically advanced nation on the earth. Canada is 12th, and you'd be lower down the list if you didn't border us.

And lol the US is in a dead heat with China in the Olympics. Canada only has 1 gold medal and is in 25th place.

Training for the Winter Olympics. And put the medals into perspective to the population. ",,2012-08-07 00:51:26
"US gold medals: 29

Canada gold medals: 1

The US does not have 29 times as many people as Canada. And population doesn't equate to skilled athletes. As if one American athlete should have 10 times the chances of winning as a Canadian just because the population of his/her country is 10 times larger. Comparing medals to population doesn't make sense. It's more logical to compare medals to the amount of athletes competing.",hivemind6,2012-08-07 01:27:41
It was different in [2010](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics_medal_table). And the amount of Athletes per country isn't a good comparison either. Bigger countries can send better athletes on a broader scale while smaller countries like Canada and Australia send a lot of athletes that are happy to take part in the olympics without having a real chance on winning.,,2012-08-07 01:30:36

"Firstly, russia and the ESA (European space agency) don't have a single rover on mars, let alone 4 like NASA does. And if it wasn't for America there wouldn't of been an ISS for your robotic arm to be put on, which is one of the only major things Canada has done in space. 

Oh and, we're second in the olympics for most medals, when Canada is in 11 place.
