"There has never been a point in the entire history of the United States that we as a country or our government given two shits about the rights of foreigners. Expecting that to be different today is beyond naive.

Also, that quote is misinterpreted all the time, because when it was written 'men' actually meant white, anglo-saxon, protestant, land owners. The fact that later on that definition was slowly expanded to include ""low quality"" Europeans (irish, polish, slavic, spanish, etc.), women, and [grudgingly] brown &amp; yellow people should tell you something about where we place our values in this country. Also, don't forget that we still treat immigrants like disposable trash, even when when they come from countries that we nominally stole half our land area from. Don't get me started with the natives either.

Basically, PRISM is par for the course around here and it's also completely legal as far as our laws are concerned.

One last thing; Reddit and the 5 people who browse EFF on a daily basis might get hyperventilated about this, but no one in this country really cares what the NSA does until someone actually digs up evidence that there is a large program to read/listen to the personal correspondences of innocent Americans (read: white Bible-Belters). This has been going on for at least 6-7 years and was first reported on in 2007. No one batted an eye. No senator/house member on the security committee has lost their job over it (and they have made no secret that they've known about this for at least half a decade). No one has challenged the FISA courts. No one has been asked to pay any political price for this kind of expansion of government power. The reason isn't because 'no one knows' it's because no one cares (and by 'no-one' I mean any political majority anywhere in the nation). Enough of us bought the 'security &gt; liberty' garbage after 9/11 that it's really going to take decades to unwind, and by then things like PRISM are going to be facts of life. If you want stuff like this gone, file winnable lawsuits and vote the sort of people who stand in lockstep with the NSA out of office.

"&gt;There has never been a point in the entire history of the United States that we as a country or our government given two shits about the rights of foreigners. ... Also, that quote is misinterpreted all the time, because when it was written 'men' actually meant white, anglo-saxon, protestant, land owners. 

As I've stated elsewhere, this is irrelevant. The Declaration of Independence at the very least establishes that there is at least *some* class of people who are entitled to certain rights by nature, and that it is their prerogative to reject subjugation by any government which denies them those rights. That we've expanded that class to include women, minorities, the landless, etc, doesn't matter because this tramples on the rights of even that limited class.

&gt;Expecting that to be different today is beyond naive.

There's a difference between naivety and idealism. Nobody thinks we've ever succeeded in living to this standard, but I believe when Jefferson included those words he meant them as an ideal toward which we should continually strive. I think, despite his conflicted behavior which was subject to the realities of his time, he hoped that ""all men"" would one day include all of humanity.

&gt;Enough of us bought the 'security &gt; liberty' garbage after 9/11 that it's really going to take decades to unwind, and by then things like PRISM are going to be facts of life. If you want stuff like this gone, file winnable lawsuits and vote the sort of people who stand in lockstep with the NSA out of office.

No doubt; but that unwinding will require a change in the public's understanding of our ideals. That's what I'm arguing for here. Our nation's founders espoused a primitive concept of human rights before human rights was even a thing. The concept of Natural Law is central to the enlightenment era philosophy which spawned our nation, and one need nothing but to be acknowledged as a human being to be entitled to their [natural rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_right).

&gt;No one has challenged the FISA courts

It is my understanding that this is not the case, but that the [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapper_v._Amnesty_International) has been that the Court has claimed that the plaintiffs have lacked standing because it was impossible to prove they were being monitored due to the monitoring being secret. It may not be enough to get SCOTUS to hear a case against it, but at the very least increases public awareness of the issue and hopefully gets us a step closer to it.

&gt;As a point to remember; we're still living with similar policies and programs from Cold War today (our nuclear missile stockpile, for example).

Eh... I'm not sure our nuclear missile stockpile is quite analogous. Sure, it is a Cold War relic which poses a threat to us today, but it would be much harder to convince most people it was unconstitutional. The Constitution says nothing directly about our right to privacy, but the idea of the ""[penumbral emanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut)"" of that right has become much more commonly understood and accepted as a given in our society.

&gt;It takes time, sorry. Deal with it.

It does. This is how we deal with it, by advocating it and arguing for it. Other than running for office or taking up arms, what else is there to do but try and be a voice for that ideal?",utexaspunk,2013-06-08 22:23:47

That aint my government - please be careful when using 'us', 'we' and 'our' on an international website - especially when we are on the topic of discussing what is being done to people who are not living in america.

EDIT: As usual the Americans don't like it when someone tries to tell them that America is not the only country in the world. 

However, this does explain why some Americans thought it a good idea to use the phrase 'the policy only targets “non-US persons”' as an excuse for what they were doing.

Non US persons are a myth and if they exist you can simply deny their existence, because everything we can use with 'we', 'our' and 'us' is way better and superior than everything else on this planet. Denying the existence of global warming and stuff like that is also easily explained, as are the theories denying creationism, because: 'These are not **our** theories!'

 Police chief Öisten Maeland resigned in protest to the poor support from his superiors in the justice ministry. So that his job could be done better.

The american administration decided to invade multiple foreign nations. Enact innumerable restrictions on its citizens in the name of public safety – except guns or explosives, that would be utter madness /s – without showing tangible evidence to their long term effects.

No court. No attempt at gathering intelligence by capturing him and his family members.

I'm not sure it's a good point, though. The U.S. has warrants out for the arrests of several people, and many of them choose to remain in the countries they are. (Often the countries deny extradition, because they are not satisfied with the justice system in the U.S)

These people have a chance to surrender, and choose not to. Some of them are even wanted for murder. It irks me, that the U.S. have shown that they are willing to send soldiers into other countries to kill (or apprehend, if they get the chance) these people.

I mean, it's not even like they held a trial without him there (which is a real thing - in absentia trials).

Americans don't have rights in the eyes of the US government. ,todayiswednesday1,2013-06-08 07:14:20
"&gt; non-Americans even have rights in the eyes of the US government


Ideally, yes, but it varies by context.


For example, the US Constitution provides, in Article 1, Section 9, that ""The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.""


This is a 900 year old legal principle, the phrasing of which implies a pre-existing right which the government may not restrict.  As such, and, given the phraseology, it ought to apply to everybody, it does not specify ""for US citizens.""  We're backing away from that one with provisions in the 2012 NDAA, and through provisions of the Military Commissions Act that were ruled unconstitutional, but keep coming back.


Guantanamo detainees also have rights, though we're ignoring them.  Their rights come from the Geneva Convention.  The US Constitution says that treaties count as law domestically.  One of the main reasons we opened up that detention facility outside the territorial United States was to evade our obligations under the Geneva Conventions.

",norbertus,2013-06-08 07:19:19
"American's do not have rights in the eyes of the US government, what makes you think they give a shit about someone who is not even a citizen?

Yes, there is no such thing as a ""right"". It's a ""feel good"" word to make people think they matter. Name one ""right"" that can not be taken away, and I will change my opinion. If it can be taken away, it is *not* a right. Therefore, we have no rights.",ThatsMrAsshole2You,2013-06-08 07:27:18

"A friend of mine was ~~indicted~~ subpoenad by a grand jury to reveal what she knew about a network of anarchists in the Portland area. They raided her house and took her and her roommates computers and phones. The fed stated that they were investigating an act of coordinated vandalism but the paperwork filed for her indictment predated the vandalism in question.

She was indicted by a grand jury and refused to testify, so they granted her immunity from prosecution which removed her fifth amendment right to not self incriminate allowing her to be charged with contempt of court. So charged they placed her in solitary confinement for weeks.

The point is that all of this happened without her ever being investigated for a crime. All that was necessary for her to be caught in such a web is a knowledge of what her social web looked like. 

Encryption does not address the fact that if the NSA is gathering metadata for each call you make, if you use facebook, or if you use any sort of electronic communication then the federal government can and does use that sort of data to begin surveillance. Even if you are using encryption and they can't see the actual contents they can and will put you and your friends in a dark box alone for extended periods of time for refusing to speak to them just on the basis that you know a few people who they are interested in.

"&gt;critical thinking ability.

This is a sacred ability that few know how to exercise properly.

It all started long ago, long before the internet, 24/7 news networks, and invasive corporate advertisers. It started early in our lives, pre and post internet introduction to the mainstream. It started with an education system essentially designed to turn people into apathetic, close minded, self centered individuals, who can't be bothered to learn more, or to challenge the status quo, to be sheep and stand aside to let those in power do what they want. Add to that Church which directly tells you to do what school does indirectly. Its been like this since the late 19th century, and over time it has allowed the government to gradually steal away the rights of its citizens.

The most important document in American law is the constitution which is gradually being destroyed. Why is it that people are so concerned about their 2nd amendment rights, while either ignoring or supporting the government as it walks all over the 4th.

What I'm getting at is that basically people need to learn to use critical thinking again, to break the cycle that's been beaten into us since childhood. The hard part is how to do this now?

Sorry for the rant but this shit is frightening, especially because it can't be passed off as some tin foil hat conspiracy. And this is just one small part that is indicative of much larger problem.

Yet it didn't thirty years ago. Also, you might want to look at how China is doing with even more standardized testing, overcrowding and impersonal treatment (much better, is how).

I'd argue the exact opposite. Every effort in education now revolves around the lowest common denominator, where it used to only be about excellence.

How was she blindsighted? She was in with an anarchist cell that was committing crimes. She knew who her friends were. She knew what they were doing. She was a part of it.",no_en,2013-06-08 01:30:39
"She was certainly not ""in with an anarchist cell that was committing crimes"", there is a reason she was never charged with anything. The point of grand jury investigations is usually information discovery. 

The event in question was part of a may day occupy protest, in which 80-90 black bloc anarchists collected to join the protest and five or six of of them defaced a court house. The way many black bloc protests work is through decentralized anonymous groups. 

Now, some people who were raided were charged with crimes. All house computers and phones were seized, and she was never charged. She was not part of a black bloc cell, but because of the way such cells are organized the tactic of choice for going after them is to force a great many people who may know other people to testify and begin to suss out who was involved.

Because counterculture communities are closely knit people like this girl, who may be associated in local environmental groups, labor unions, LGBT rights activists, anarchist bookstores, community gardens, anti-capitalist associations of any kind may well be connected to peop, in the same way that I am connected to her. By collecting metadata from phones you could be identified as knowing sufficient people that you are indicted. 

This girl was not black bloc. She was not ""in with a cell"". The people who were wound up not being compelled to testify via the immunity loophole so that they could be prosecuted. She was a counterculture girl from Portland who knew the wrong people. ",mz27,2013-06-08 01:51:50

"While this is useful, it doesn't really address any of the services related to this most recent event.

The allegation from [the slides](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/) is that the NSA is able to tap into:

* E-mail
* Chat - video, voice
* Videos
* Photos
* Stored data
* VoIP (which really should be filed under Chat - video, voice)
* File Transers
* Video conferencing (again, this should be filed under Chat - video, voice)
* Notification of target activity - logins, etc.
* Online Social Networking details

What's common about all of those (and the companies mentioned) is that it's implying that they're compromised on the server side.  The tools you mention are either useful for strengthening / anonymizing the connection to the server or the client side (your own computer).

tl;dr: Thieves broke into the bank, possibly thanks to an inside man who still works there.  This post suggests driving an armored car to the bank and using a safe at home.

We authenticate the public key used to generate the shared secret by signing it with the server's private key when the user is created, or a new key pair is generated.  We then check the signature against the  server's public key which is hard coded in the client.

"The point of Truecrypt et al. is that it provides resources for plausible deniability - see its documentation page on [hidden volumes](http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=hidden-volume). To quote:

&gt; It may happen that you are forced by somebody to reveal the password to an encrypted volume. There are many situations where you cannot refuse to reveal the password (for example, due to extortion). Using a so-called hidden volume allows you to solve such situations without revealing the password to your volume.

&gt; The principle is that a TrueCrypt volume is created within another TrueCrypt volume (within the free space on the volume). Even when the outer volume is mounted, it should be impossible to prove whether there is a hidden volume within it or not, because free space on *any* TrueCrypt volume is always filled with random data when the volume is created and no part of the (dismounted) hidden volume can be distinguished from random data. Note that TrueCrypt does not modify the file system (information about free space, etc.) within the outer volume in any way.

(see footnotes on the linked page, though.)

Plausible deniability in such matters is important. Likewise with OTR - see [CodeCon slides introducing OTR [pdf]](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-codecon.pdf) (the aforementioned pidgin-otr is one of the plugins implementing the OTR protocol.)

"I have a question: If NSA is monitoring services like gmail, facebook, hotmail, yahoo, skype, then how does ANY of the above help? The way I'm thinking about this is: I use all that stuff above and I'm protected until I actually log in to one of those services, then I""m screwed no matter what because the owner of said service has a log of everything I am doing, and he gives that information over to the NSA, or the NSA ""hacks"" it directly from them, and not me.

Also you can vote for other people and tell everyone you know about that BS. They'll give you as few freedom as possible and if it keeps going like that, the USA might become a ""better"" East Germany.

"Edit: Wouldn't Mega be a better choice, since you hold the decryption key? Meaning that even if somehow authorities got a hold of Mega's servers and such, unless they could crack the encryption on their own, they wouldn't be able to find out what data the users have stored? And with a free account you get 50 GB storage. And you know Kim dotcom hates the states!

Thanks for the reply btw :)

The university I graduated in ported their email system to Google, and that means all stored data, all stored e-mails got ported over. Thankfully they gave us a choice to stay in the old java system run by the university locally or go through Google. I thought school e-mail should be run locally, so I stayed with the old system. I hope they will keep it running indefinitely, although I highly doubt it.

"Yes you can maybe use a Chinese server instead because they don't spy on people we all know that.

Anyway, even if a reasonable country like Germany had alternatives, the internet is structured for legacy reasons so that the US carries a lot of weight in international information networks. They also throw their weight around to pressure everyone who isn't China or Russia into compliance. Recent deals with Switzerland proved they have the power to make Swiss banks disclose everything their clients do. Switzerland wouldn't have the weight to go against it even if it was unpopular over here. But the sad news is basically no country alone has enough weight to resist such demands.",canteloupy,2013-06-08 00:47:23
"It depends which measures we're talking about.

* HTTPS Everywhere, VPNs prevent people from knowing what you're doing by listening ""on the wire"", but if the actual site is snitching, then it doesn't change anything.

* Tor also prevents the site you're browsing from knowing who you are. As long as you don't sign in (obviously), then the site can't really snitch.

* AdBlock, NoScript will for example keep your browser from contacting Google when browsing sites that use Google Ads or Google Analytics, so there's some privacy gain here.

* Disk, email, IM, voice encryption only protect the affected medium, obviously. In the case of GPG (for emails), for example, it can be used either to sign emails (thus proving that you are indeed the sender), or encrypt them to prevent them from being read on the wire or by the mail server. This means that for example GMail can still know who you're talking to, but not what you're saying. Encrypting is more involved though, since the person you're sending the mail to must also be using GPG and have communicated their public GPG key.",TarMil,2013-06-07 23:59:54

In 2006, an Internet censorship system was introduced to help fight child pornography. Our dear government kept promising over and over again that the censorship would never be extended to cover any other kind of content than CP. Last year, The Pirate Bay was added to the list. There have also been some vague talks of censoring foreign gambling sites, as those are allegedly stealing customers from our national gambling monopolies.

I won't start rambling about our MPAA-equivalents as they are somewhat irrelevant, although they are currently the worst ones willing to kill whatever privacy we have these days.

I'm not saying what we have going on is nearly as bad as what's happening in the USA or even certain dictatorships around the world, I'm merely trying to point out that Europe isn't perfect either when it comes to citizens' privacy and rights. We may be behind you guys in spying on citizens and violating their privacy, but we're catching up.

It is also worth mentioning that most people in Europe use the same American services and websites as you (I know people know this already, that's the reason why people over here are furious right now). I know I'll be looking for some alternatives for Facebook, Gmail, Dropbox etc. but I'm afraid the majority of people just don't care.

"1. Fire up Tor, not just the Tor browser bundle if you're want to use other programs (such as Enigmail) with it. Tor bounces your connection between many computers and should make you anonymous. However applications must be configured to use it, any application with a proxy setting should be able to use Tor. It's not the best idea to indiscriminately send everything through Tor, but https (and make sure that's actually enabled) and encrypted mail should be safe.

2. Sign up to Gmail without disclosing personal information. Common sense is very important.

3. Encrypt your message using your friends public key with PGP, either manually or using Enigmail (configured to use Tor). This now prevents eavesdroppers from reading your communication.

4. Send message.

They'll now only be able to know when the message was sent and the mail box it went to. They shouldn't be able to work out who you are, where you're from or what you said. If the recipient follows the same process they should also be anonymous. And that's in the worst case scenario; communicating when the medium is closely monitored.

PGP is also not limited to email, it can be used over anything that transfers text. You could post your message to Pastebin and, despite it being public PGP will prevent others from reading it. PGP can also sign messages so the recipient can be sure that it's from you regardless of the communication medium. 

As an example the following is this message encrypted via PGP with Jacob Appelbaum's public keys, so only he should be able to decrypt it:

"Give me a second... edit pending. 

Edit:

**Category: Browser Privacy**  
HTTPS Everywhere - allows you to use encrypted access to website which have HTTPS (the S is key) functionality. Some sites make this difficult to use, such as by defaulting to the HTTP version. This browser extension helps with that silently in the background for both Chrome and Firefox. You will notice for your online banking, for example, that they default to use of HTTPS for more secure usage.  
Adblock Plus and EasyList - allows you to avoid ads, essentially. This includes cookies (bits of temporary data from websites) designed to track your websites visited.  
Ghostery - alerts you to which services track you when you visit a website. Allows you to block this where you choose. Warning, you may be surprised by how many there are.  
NoScript - Firefox only, but prevents scripts from automatically running on websites (Java, Javascript, Flash, etc). This can be useful to avoid some malicious scripts, but also limits your web usage a bit (for example I can't use my preferred internet radio with NoScript). However, it does have the option to add trusted websites that you allow to run scripts.  
NotScript - NoScript for Chrome.

**VPNs:**  
This list is for Virtual Private Network services. I use one called PrivateInternetAccess, but the list given is just for companies in various locations. TorrentFreak has a great analysis of some [here](http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/). Essentially, what a VPN does is works as a middleman to encrypt everything you send and receive through the internet. Anyone listening to the data inbetween the VPN and you would see only encrypted randomness. Anyone listening to it between the VPN and whatever you are accessing would not be able to trace it beyond the VPN service to you. Instead of the normal you -&gt; request something from website -&gt; sent to you, think of it as you -&gt; encrypted request something from VPN -&gt; VPN gets from website -&gt; VPN sends you it encrypted -&gt; your computer decrypts and shows you it.  The reason you would need anything beyond a VPN is that we tend to log into things or otherwise identify ourselves, and companies tend to give this data to authorities freely. 

**Internet Anonymization**  
Tor and related services work kind of like VPNs, for our purposes, with more connections than one. Instead of routing your encrypted data through a server somewhere that you pay, Tor instead routes it through volunteer computers or 'nodes'. You can also volunteer for the Tor network.  
However, be careful a little with Tor. If you volunteer as an exit node it is possible someone using Tor for a nefarious purpose would make it seem to come from you. Additionally, Tor is popular for situations of avoiding restrictive internet laws (such as during the Arab Spring). Some people believe it should be reserved for this purpose, while others do not.  

**Disk Encryption**  
These softwares are programs you download to encrypt your data on your computer (hard drive or SSD). They allow you to create a section that cannot be accessed by anyone without the password. Without the password, it appears to be random data and is not useful. I thoroughly enjoy TrueCrypt and suggest you donate a little when downloading their free software.

**File, Email, IM, Voice, Phone, SMS Encryption**  
As you can see by now, there are many ways to encrypt data. These services or software allow encrypted communication through the various methods. One caveat is that some of them require both parties communicating to use the service. I would also add that the Tor project has created Android functionality to that list.  

**Google Alternative:**  
DuckDuckGo is a search engine which does not store any of your data without your permission. They are less invasive and have a more transparent model than Google. In my opinion this is largely enabled by their small business size and absence of other products focused on ad revenue.

**Digital P2P Currency**  
Bitcoin is a deep conversation, and can be learned about at /r/BitCoin. I highly recommend it, for interest sake. The two sentence summary... BitCoin is a functional digital currency that is not controlled by any state and has no centralized bank. Transactions are anonymous and an increasing number of goods can be purchased through it, both digital and tangible. Interestingly, you can also trade BitCoin for various other currencies at some digital exchange companies. 

**Live Anonymous/Secure Linux**  
TAILS is an operating system on a USB. You plug it in, run a version of Linux through it, and completely bypass whatever nonsense might be on the computer you are using. It is prebundled with secure applications like those listed above.

Does that help a bit?

Edit2: So, it is recommended to at least set up a couple background things - like adding Ghostery to just see what's tracking you. I would also highly recommend considering a VPN and what price that privacy is worth (try creating a dollar value on it in your mind before checking out any of the TorrentFreak reviews).",ZippityD,2013-06-07 22:54:03

Yes but they don't work so well. The free ones generally have intrusive ads bundled (permanent extra banner on all web pages or occasional new window pop ups even when not browsing) or are abhorrently slow.

&gt;Browser Privacy: [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), [AdBlock Plus](http://adblockplus.org/en/firefox) + [EasyList](http://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/), [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/), [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) (FireFox), [NotScript](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notscripts/odjhifogjcknibkahlpidmdajjpkkcfn?hl=en) (Chrome)

* These are all plugins for Firefox or Chrome. 

    * HTTPS is a way of talking to web servers using a secret language that only you and the other webserver know, so if anyone is listening in, they probably won't understand. Many sites support this, but often people don't use it. This plugin makes it so you always try and talk in a secret language.

    * AdBlock Plus is a plugin that removes commercials from the internet. Easylist is a plugin for the plugin, which gives it a list of all the commercials so that it knows what to block. Personally I use fanboy's list, because it also has additional lists for annoying things like ""social toolbars"" etc.

    * Ghostery is a plugin that stops websites from being allowed to follow you around and snoop on what other websites you look at. Fanboy's adblock list has a tracking block list, but I don't know how well it compares to ghostery.

    * Noscript/Notscript is a plugin that stops webpages from running javascript, which is a programming language that lets webpages do cool things like dropdown menus, interactive things like when a button lights up when you mouse over it. It can also be used for bad things, so this plugin allows you to choose whether sites can run javascript or not. It's a bit annoying if you don't understand how it works, since it blocks too much stuff and breaks a lot of webpages until you allow them to use javascript, but it can protect you from a lot of bad stuff.

&gt; VPNs: [BTGuard](http://btguard.com/) (Canada), [ItsHidden](http://www.itshidden.eu/) (Africa), [Ipredator](https://ipredator.se/) (Sweden), [Faceless.me](http://faceless.me/) (Cyprus / Netherlands)

* A VPN is a ""Virtual Private Network"". What this lets you do is take all of the stuff you do on the internet, and funnel it through another computer, somewhere else on the planet. Anyone who's watching thinks that you're coming from the VPN's computer, so they can't figure out where your computer really is.

&gt;Internet Anonymization: [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), [I2P](http://i2p2.de/)

* Tor is ""The Onion Router"". It's called that because like an onion, it has layers. It's like a VPN, but layers upon layers of VPNs, so not only are you funneling your internets through someone else's computer somewhere else in the world, but *they* are passing it on to another computer, *somewhere else* in the world, and so on. This is very secure, but it's also very slow, and should probably only be used if you really need it, like if a policeman has done a bad thing, and you need to tell on him but you really can't let that policeman know who said it.

&gt;Disk Encryption: [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) (Windows / OSX / Linux), [File Vault](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4790) (Mac).

* This is a way of scrambling up all the files on your computer so that other people can't read them unless they have your key to unscramble them. If you try to cross borders, people may take your computer and not give it back unless you tell them how to unscramble it though, so be aware of that.

&gt;File/Email Encryption: [GPGTools](https://www.gpgtools.org/) + [GPGMail](https://www.gpgtools.org/gpgmail/index.html) (Mac),  [Enigmail](http://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php) (Windows / OSX / Linux)

* These are ways to send email, scrambled up in a language only you and the person you're sending it to can understand. It's like passing a note in class using a secret code. These can be pretty easy to set up, and are widely used, though you both have to know how to use it before anything's secret.

&gt;IM Encryption: [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) + [Pidgin OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/)

* The same thing as above, but for MSN or Yahoo Instant Messenger, AIM, or whatever else. These are less common, and you'll definitely need to set things up with whoever you plan to talk to ahead of time.

&gt;IM/Voice Encryption: [Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/), [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/)

* These are ways to talk to each other using microphones, which can be set up ways that no one else can hear what you're saying.

&gt;Phone/SMS Encryption: [WhisperSystems](http://www.whispersystems.org/), [Ostel](https://guardianproject.info/apps/ostel/), [Spore](https://myceli.al/projects/spore-android-client), [Silent Circle](https://silentcircle.com/) ($$$)

* See above. Same thing but with telephones.

&gt;Google Alternative: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

* Every time you visit google, google collects some information about you, and tries to ""paint a picture"" of you, to try and understand more about you. This information is private though, and you might not like that. DuckDuckGo takes a bunch of people's google searches and mixes them together so that google doesn't know who's who.

&gt;Digital P2P Currency: [BitCoin](http://bitcoin.org/)

* I can't ELI5 how this works, but it's digital cash.

&gt;Live Anonymous/Secure Linux: [TAILS Linux](https://tails.boum.org/)

* This is a whole operating system for your computer. If you want to be super paranoid, you can put a CD into your computer and turn it on, and instead of going into Windows or Mac OS, it'll start up with a completely different system called Linux, which is already set up to be super secure and probably has all the above programs already installed, though I dunno cause I've never tried it.

If your computer is still around and not been formatted there should be a file somewhere on it called wallet.dat. it contains the private keys for your wallet. If you have formatted your computer since then it's likely the coins are lost. If you used an online wallet its likely they are lost as well since most if the online wallets from that time are gone or were hacked. ,throckmortonsign,2013-06-07 23:43:28

1. Learn it.

2. If you can't learn it, find someone who does understand it and can babysit your system.

3. If you can't find anyone, make a decision: do I want privacy or not?

4. If you don't want privacy, don't worry.

5. If you want privacy:

* Don't post *any* personal information online.

* Don't use email, Facebook, IM, or any other intermediary between you and your friends.

I'm using it on a 27-inch screen, with multiple workspaces. I've learned that maximising windows isn't generally a good idea on a screen this size, but there you go. GNOME3's Activities screen is an amazing improvement on the concept of a ""start menu"". And the whole thing is very easy to control using your choice of keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. All in all, it's a next-gen interface like Microsoft was going for with Modern UI, except I feel that the GNOME team did much better.

"Average person, this how you should use Tor. 

Have a reasonably **high speed connection** without low data caps.  That's cable, or an OC3 or whatever.  If you're paying by the byte, this is not for you.

Set Tor up as a **relay**, but not as an exit node.  A relay passes on information through the Tor network for other users, thereby speeding up their connection.  Because the Tor network is encrypted and mixed, nobody (except the NSA^NSA ) will know what you are relaying, and you will never be responsible for it.  Exit nodes are for more experienced individuals and not for you.

When you wish to surf upon the high way of infons, keep a Tor browser window open and a regular browser window open.

**Use the Tor browser for**

* Light pages that will load fast anyway, 
* Low urgency pages where loading time is not an issue,
* risky clicks 

**Do not use Tor for** pages with unencrypted logins or that involve identifying information.  Exit nodes are known to grab unencrypted passwords and record traffic.  So no

* Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.
* Banking, medical
* Any communication where your personal identity is or could be exposed

**Use you regular browser for everything else.**

With this approach, instead of giving up on Tor because its TOO SLOOOOOW! the average user can 

* enjoy high speed internet for most things,
* contribute to the Tor network by providing a relay, and
* enjoy the protection Tor offers when and where they need it.

I pretty much hate fiddling with my computer. That's the reason I pretty much just game on console, even if I'm developing games on PC.

Speaking generally may have been in better taste but, hear me out.

What I've said is the truth. The inability to learn and adapt to new technology is not beyond anyone, and it is what is going to cause the older generations to be phased out of society much more quickly than has ever happened in the past. 

Sometimes cold and unyielding truth is the only thing that will shock people into understanding the situation, or at least considering it. When people get mad they want to argue and disagree, but to do that they have to think about it, and why what I've said is wrong and in doing so may be forced to realize that... I'm not. I'm not wrong, I'm just being a dick about it.

I just don't want to see people who have not grown up with computers become incapable and more dependent as they age. 

Another issue that frustrates me is the progression of our technology to accommodate for this deliberate rejection of understanding. 

I feel that it would be like people refusing to use cars until they can drive themselves because driving is too complicated and dangerous. You end up with severely restricted but visually appealing and simplistic designs intended for people with limited imagination and knowledge for how to utilize this technology. If this mentality pervades and expands, the profitability of a product will only be reliable if it is designed to be used by stupid people and those with absolutely no curiosity or desire to learn.

You are probably an emotionally unstable teenager who was abused by family or the people around you so you take your anger out anonymously over the Internet because you are too scared to confront your problems directly. You try to cause pain to random people over the Internet because the people in your life cause you pain.

Just stand up for yourself. If you're in highschool, fight the guy who keeps messing with you. It's your only chance to do it without getting arrested and, this is coming from a kid who was picked on, it's the only language they understand. The only time I was left alone was after one guy started a fight and I won. 

Even if you get your ass kicked, make yourself a hard target and they won't fuck with you anymore. Be fair, don't try and injure anyone. Be as respectful to the authority as possible and tell them your situation. Highschool functions by prison rules, and sometimes you just have to show them that you won't take their shit without a fight.

The amount of overlap between the 'old' you and the 'new' you is entirely up to you. If you publish your home address, date of birth and real name on every site you visit, then it won't take much effort for a web-crawling bot to link those instances together and build a picture of your interests.

Also, with the phone they have your movements very accurately traced over long time periods.

Tor is also open source. Anyone can examine the source code and see exactly what it does. So you can examine every detail of your Tor client and ensure that it works as it is supposed to.

There is still a danger that the government could run a significant proportion of the Tor nodes and snoop on traffic that way. In this circumstance Tor still provides some protection but traffic routes could be statistically tracked.

* Corporations are in bed with government and vice versa [read the press releases by the Corps.  Most use same phrase: **direct access; voluntary**]

* A law is only as good as its interpretation; the more general its terminology the more useful it becomes, like a multipurpose tool.

* Obama is a Republican in the sense that he thinks leaders know better than the laity [intelligence correlates with morality].  That decision to invade Pakistan sovereign soil to kill Osama now seems more like a warning sign of overreaching behavior than a courageous act.

* Republicans, who've been making hamburger out of hay for 5 years, finally get a real populist scandal and... turns out they're for it, although it would be the best argument for States' rights and the inefficiency of the Federal Gov.  [trillions of stored communications; one claim of a successful prevention of a terrorist attack]

* Businessmen and politicians are willing to wrangle and reduce every conceivable act to adumbrate legalese which, in the words of the Bard, extenuates rather than enforces.

* The government thinks spying is okay as long as it is on a foreigner [if a state managed to secede from the Union in protest, guess what, it's now legal to spy on you.]

* The government will spy on hundreds of millions of its own citizens in order to catch one alleged and supposedly would-be terrorist.  [How about terrorists just start autodialing entire phonebooks?  Then everyones records are legally available].

* The terrorists won.  Plain and simple.  I'm more livid with my government for its indifference to its own tyranny- as all presumption is, which justifies itself, the act which define its existence as imperative and in an irrefragable dominion- than I am with any shadowy foreigner who mumbles under his breath about his opprobrium for another's culture.",,2013-06-07 23:00:21

"&gt; From a purely fiscal standpoint, it's quite accurate to say Bush adopted liberal policies. Medicare Part D was the largest expansion of socialized medicine in United States history.

I disagree.  Medicare D was an unfunded giveaway to the pharmaceuticals.  It's not an expansion of socialized medicine, but rather doubling down on socialized corporatism.


Very, very big difference.


The policies Bush pushed for were along the same lines of what we're doing with the billion dollar per quarter energy industry by subsidizing them regardless of their profits.

Basically the antithesis of anything a liberal or leftist would ever push for.


As for no-child left-behind that was an attempt to reform funding already in place since the 60s.  Mostly through an emphasis on standardized testing.

The third point is poorly worded in a few ways. It implies leadership is granted based on morality and intelligence (it honestly should be), when it is really based upon the people's perceptions (which may be skewed) of their leaders. Second, you imply that Republicans think that ""leaders know better than the laity."" Not only is this a generalization, but it is baseless. Neither party implies that leaders are more intelligent or morally superior to the layman. Republicans represent the power of the (people, states, corporations) to exercise their freedoms, whereas Democrats represent the right to these freedoms(choice, equality).

"Revolution will see a new paradigm. The problem with modern states, especially in the case of the US, is that you can't really use violence to confront them: they are too good at responding and deligitimizing that in the media. You can't use *their* system to get change since it's a flawed system to begin with and would be too far gone for any sort of mechanical solution, and protesting peacefully in the streets is also ineffective by extension.

The only real way you can revolutionize society is by developing technologies that make it *safe* and *easy* to hit the state where they aren't expecting it, and where it really hurts. The state takes advantage of the fact that its tax cattle keeps handing over the money. No matter what you say or do in opposition to them, it doesn't mean anything because you can't withhold the wealth they steal from society to continue their tour-de-force of destruction.

Making tax evasion and unlicensed commerce safe and easy for most of society will be what overturns this state. The precursors for these technological development are already well established and in use. Bitcoin takes back commerce from the state. It certainly does have it's shortcomings, but those are simple engineering problems that will be polished with time. I think the open source movement will have the single most profound impact for our generation with respect to gaining freedom from the state. There are many reasons for this, but the main reason is that the institutional costs of Intellectual Property development and compliance are simply too great. The state holds monopolies on patents such that if you want to get one you have to comply with their stacks and stacks of regulatory bullshit -- which simply costs too much money. Our generation has enough access to information and technology to really bolster a very high level of open source technological development. Tor (access to the Deep Net), CJDNS, namecoin, Open Transaction, and PGP will fill in many areas of difficulty as far as communications go. 

We need not lay our hands on the leviathan to dismantle its apparatus of destruction on society. We simply need to develop our own society beyond the grasps of the state and when the state falls of its own accord it won't be taking the rest of society with it. ",eitauisunity,2013-06-08 02:28:44

Yes.  This is an excellent point.  This is always the problem.  This is why I abandoned the idea of states.  A state is an entity with the monopoly on the initiation of force in a given geographic region.

If an evil person or group of evil people could control this entity then there is no hope of resisting it.

&gt;Without government life is nasty, brutish and short. I believe we always need some form of governance. Anarchy is an utopia, history has thought us that much.

Governance is different than Government(big G).   Under anarchy or voluntary systems, people will form their own systems of governance.  For example, if you buy a road pass from a private road owner you will have to follow the governing rules of that road system.  If you don't your pass will be revoked and you will not be allowed entry on to that road anymore.

The same sort of governance works all the time on smaller scales even today.  When you voluntarily exchange money for groceries, you are voluntarily acting under a system of governance.

Anarchy does not preclude these contractual forms for governance in the slightest.

&gt;At least some people will try to abuse the system and no system is also a system.

It is a system of smaller systems.  Where you can choose to not participate in any one of them and there is no force that stops you.  You can shop around just like you do for most everything you already shop around for.  The only difference is you can now choose you own protection services, your own schools for your children, your own ""national defense"" policy.

How do you protect the people in a anarchistic society against someone or some organization that is trying to get or has a monopoly of violence. Because once somebody has this monopoly he/she has all the power in the world. And trust me somebody will try to get it. ,LoL_feminism,2013-06-09 02:15:33
"Well, voluntarism is an ethic you can possess regardless of what other people are doing. As long as your recognize that the initiation of violence and coercion (which is what I simply define as aggression) regardless of what funny costumes, or what arbitrary rules attempt to justify that aggression and you reject the use of aggression I would consider you a voluntarist. In the absence of using aggression for transactions you are, by default, transacting on a voluntary basis. 

&gt;Without government life is nasty, brutish and short.

I don't think this is actually true. It may seem to be the case since it has been hard to escape the grasp of the state, but there is no reason why society can't figure out how to peacefully transact and avoid institutionalized aggression. Of course there will always be some amount of criminals and people who use aggression, but it's the fact that it is institutionalized is what is so destructive to society. 

If you consider ""governance"" as the puzzle of resolving disputes that crop up among individuals who share a common geographical area, then that is very simple to do without an entity that has a monopoly on dispute resolution (which is essentially what the state does). [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o) is one construct of how that could play out. We will need some form of governance, in so far as we will always need a way to resolve disputes, but using aggression to institute a monopoly over how that is done has failed demonstrably throughout history.

Consider this: Technology has a tendency to trend towards individualism. Examples of this would be music. It used to be a collective activity to go see an orchestra perform, and even that wasn't very accessible to most of society at some point in history. It took a group of people to play the instruments, it took a group of people to watch to justify the costs of having the performing group come together. Now, most people have a device in their pocket that will serve up whatever music they wish to listen to from pretty much any era in a matter of minutes. Transportation, education, pretty much every technology is seen better if it can serve individual preferences in a cheap and convenient manner. Technology is also used to solve problems (problems as in puzzles) for individuals or groups of individuals. So, if you look at govern*ment* as a technology that we have used to solve the problems (puzzles) that arise out of govern*ance* then government is an obsolete collectivized form of technology that can be replaced by more individualized solutions to the problem of governance. I think this will be some form of voluntarism.

One dispute that commonly arises from people having a common geography is one of scarcity of the goods and services those people need to function. Technology is extremely good at solving this problem. I believe that people get violent when they feel their needs are so overwhelmingly unmet that they resort to violence to secure the things that satisfy their needs. If you have a situation where there are *x* number of people and only enough food to feed *x-1* people per day, it is far more likely that people will be violent over how food is distributed than if you have a situation where there is enough food to feed *x+1* people per day. When you allow the market process that develops technology to develop abundances and it becomes trivial for people to satisfy their needs, it would seem to follow that people will be less likely to be violent. Of course, there will always be the Jeffrey Dahlmers of the world, but they are such a minute occurrence, and easy enough to deal with without having a monopoly on dispute resolution. If you are concerned about a few people who will kill, kidnap, rape, and steal, so you establish a system that kills, kidnaps, rapes, and steals from society to deal with those people, you aren't really dealing with an effective solution. 

I know it's hard to have faith in humanity, but I think there is an incentive of the state to give people the perception that society shouldn't have faith in itself. And when education is captured by that very same state, you can't be surprised when people grow up believing that the state needs to exist to fix every problem.

When you look at the current situation, and you see all of these people ""sworn"" to protect people, but end up just being crooks themselves, and that is overwhelmingly the trend, it's time to stop saying that it's a matter of getting the right people in to run the system and start questioning if the system is even a functional one to begin with. 

A system that aligns peoples' incentives rather than makes them adverse, which is what the state does since it creates an incentive to vie for control of the statist apparatus is likely to be far more successful than the system that exists under the state. I believe technology that enables a voluntarist ethic will be that system. 

Now, I know you tend to believe that voluntarism won't work because people will kill, kidnap, rape and steal, and that is just the way of the world. I agree with you, but there is a voluntary way to resolve those disputes. And if that way doesn't work, then the market can engineer a better way. But even then, ethics are a necessary but insufficient way of changing the world. Anti-slavery didn't become overwhelmingly adopted by society until the technology that made slavery inefficient become ubiquitous such that it was in no one's interest to use a slave for labor because they had a machine that could do the work of 50 slaves. Most peoples' ethics are a post-hoc justification for the manifestation of their preferences. If you develop technology such that the costs of violence are far greater than the costs of cooperation, then people will justify that with a more voluntarist ethic, provided that framework exists. 

It can be done, and life finds a way. People just want to be happy and productive and I think the technology to make that a reality for people in society is here, it's just a matter of changing our model of governance in order to acquire that. Fortunately the state gives you multiple opportunities to show that it is dysfunctional and destructive. It's only a matter of time before the obsolete gears of the state will be laughed at as quaint and barbaric as we do about slavery today.",eitauisunity,2013-06-08 15:47:24
"There are some places where there is no monopoly of violence from the state. Parts of Pakistan comes to mind where it has been a very long time since a government official dared to enter these regions. Some states in Africa have also failing states where there is no monopoly of violence. Warlords rule these parts of the world. And they are called warlords because, well, they wage war. These places are THE most dangerous parts of the world. I want to believe we can govern ourselves. I just see no evidence to support it.  

You say technology can take away this burden but this makes way for a whole new set of problems. If technology would rule the world doesn't that give the people who make this technology all the power in the world? What checks and balances are in place to control these people? At least the current governments have some form of accountability even if it only is because they need our vote. 

The video you posted was interesting but incomplete. How do you address market failures? There need to be a lot of rules in place in order for a free market to function. Let me give you a couple examples. I am no economist but you need a big power to control the markets. Markets are naturally imperfect 

Let me give you an example. What if one Right enforcement agency got bigger than the other ones and therefore got cheaper and better deals. More and more people would switch to this right enforcement agency and with it their power would grow. Since there is no government there is no check on what they could do with this power. Effectively making them all powerful. What if I controlled an important highway and started to ask a ridiculous toll. There is no short term alternative and I would be rich. Perfectly legal in your system. 

But not only monopolies are a problem. There are also monopsonies, or monopolistic competitions. Goods and services can also have significant externalities. For example, when a firm is producing steel, it absorbs labor, capital and other inputs, it must pay for these in the appropriate markets, and these costs will be reflected in the market price for steel. If the firm also pollutes the atmosphere when it makes steel, however, and if it is not forced to pay for the use of this resource, then this cost will be borne not by the firm but by society. 

Collective goods are also problematic. Who is paying for the street lights or a new school? Without a government who is making sure my hospital isn't selling my file to an insurance company? Yeah they say they wouldn't do it but what if they got an offer they couldn't refuse? Maybe somebody bought the hospital and decides for a change in policy. There is nobody who is going to protect my rights. In this system there are no rights.  ",LoL_feminism,2013-06-08 18:10:23
"Part 1 of 2

When you consider places in the world like Pakistan, parts of Africa, and the ever popularly referenced, Somalia, the thing you have to keep in mind is that those areas are unstable; but not only just unstable, but unstable because of other states. In Pakistan, you have a state that is essentially a battle between two states that can't gain control of the whole territory, but have the country pretty well divided. Two different groups are attempting to establish their monopoly, but they are well matched and therefore neither are able to successfully establish their monopoly. This is still a problem of the model that statism calls for. This has nothing to do with voluntarism or even anarchy for that matter.

Somalia and many parts of Africa are similar, where each warlord is trying to establish their own monopoly in whatever given geographical area, but are being challenged by other suitors to the claim. In the case of Somalia, their destabilization is due in large part to international commercial fishing coupled with corruption of the previous state decimating their livelihoods for fishing and trade. When you have an area that becomes economically impoverished as fast as Somalia did the state tends to become very destabilized very quickly as well. 

In either of these cases the problems that the state creates are not solved, and in fact made worse by the various groups trying to re/establish a monopoly on law and force, and in every case those populations do not have access to enough wealth and technology to protect themselves from the actions of the state. If the state fails, those societies do not have the ability to move out from underneath the state when it finally does collapse. This is certainly not analogous to most first world counties, and certainly not the US, where the technological wealth is incredibly abundant.

As far as the concern that the makers of technology will end up ruling the world, it is true in some sense that they will by the influence they garner by making people's lives better. The difference between that and the way a state operates, however, is that the former process is done on the basis of voluntary exchange, and the latter isn't. Even extremely large companies fail when they fail to satisfy their customers. The difference between large, powerful companies and states is that states can continue fleecing society of its wealth to carry out it's actions. If a company is seen as no longer satisfying its customers even the wealthiest companies can go under over night. There are certain cases where the state gets involved with this and subsidizes a company (think financial institutions) from failing despite it not satisfying it's customers, but again, that is a problem of the state. 

People seem to confuse the market for some sort of unified entity that somehow possess mystical powers, or can fail in some way. All the market is is a series of people acting within that market to attempt to satisfy their own interests. The checks and balances are built into a market, not because it is some mystical thing, but because people have an incentive to cooperate in the market, be peaceful, and produce things that others want. The check against a company that gains too much power that it abuses is that people who previously voluntarily supported that company choose to no longer do so and even go so far as to support a competitor. This can not be done with states without some fear of violence being committed against you. Markets *are* naturally imperfect, but this is a virtually meaningless statement when you consider that every man-made abstract model is imperfect, including states. But if you don't to replace a demonstrably dysfunctional and destructive model because you don't have something *perfect* to replace it with, then your judgement is slightly misaligned, is it not? You might say, ""What if, in a free market, some powerful business develops a nuclear weapon and decides to drop it on some foreign city!? The free market enables that, is that what you want on your hands for advocating such a monstrosity!?"" To that I would say, ""But isn't it already the case that states have developed nuclear weapons and killed millions with wars, imprisoned millions more, having done so on stolen wealth? So your proposition is that we stick with the people who we *know* will develop nukes and kill people after stealing from you instead of taking the risk of abandoning that institution in  favor of something that *might* develop a nuke and kill people?"" I think that you can see the absurdity in that reasoning, can you not?

In the case of one Rights Enforcement Agency (REO) getting larger than it's competition, and enticing customers with lower prices and then trying to take over other REO's, you claim there is no check against *because there is no government.* Just because there is no government does not mean there isn't a regulation against them. They are being regulated by the market. If an REO got large enough that there was a concern that they are going to start trying to force their competitors out of business, then I'm sure people will more than likely stop supporting them. The other factor you have to consider is that they would have to not only be fighting one main competitor, but likely several. In most markets that have multiple competitors, we see 20% market share as being quite dominant, where the rest of the competitors split up tiny portions of the remaining 80%. In the case that an REO got large enough that it was attempting to take over a geographic area to establish a monopoly, there is no government to prevent them from doing this, but there is also no government to prevent people from protecting themselves. Right now, if you live in an area where the police are corrupt and criminal, and you protect yourself against them, you may end up being charged by another layer of government for doing so. Furthermore, when you consider the interests of each REO providing a service in that market, their incentive is not to fuck over their customers or be seen as potentially turning violent. Their incentive is to provide the best service they can primarily because it is profitable to do so, secondarily because if they slip up they have to be concerned about a competitor taking their business, tertiary the costs of maintaining a violent regime in a free market are far greater than simply operating peacefully. 

As far as controlling a highway, we typically view roads as how they are constructed and plotted in a statist context. Since the state controls how and where roads can be built, we assume that in a free market for roads, someone will build roads the same way the state does. This is not the case. Like most markets, redundancy and distribution are the trends. There will likely be several equally valuable ways of getting to any one point, so if one highway owner decides to ask a ridiculous toll, they would likely make another road owner very wealthy. If you owned a road, and you were a selfish, miserly, greedy cunt, and you know that people could take another road just as easily as they could take yours, what would be more profitable for you, considering that you want as much money as you can squeeze out of society? Option A is to charge some exorbitant fee and Option B is to charge a price that beats out your competition and gets you far more traffic, but still only leaves you with a razor thin profit? if you pick the former, I question your business sense. 
Externalities are another phenomena that we look at in statist terms. What people fail to realize is that in most cases the state permits negative externalities to be born on society and protects the emitters from proper liability through the construction of corporations. Corporations are a statist entity. In a free market it would be very difficult to arbitrarily cap your liability and not pay out for damages that society has incurred as a result of your actions. There would likely be a very active insurance, consumer reports agency, and arbitration industry that made sure that people weren't violating peoples' rights through externalities. If I possess an easement to a body of clean water, and a company moves in and starts polluting it, I can call up my insurance company and say, ""Yeah, I was kind of here first, homesteaded a property with the expectation of clean water, and these guys are fucking my shit up."" Then the insurance company will contact the company and make them aware of the controversy and alert them of the dispute and request that they stop, pay for the damages, and either operate elsewhere where no easements are established, or are able to pay for people to give up their easements. If the company refuses, then the insurance company might go to an arbitrator that they contract with to give the company the opportunity to sort it out in arbitration to settle the dispute. They may not be willing to stop polluting, but they may be willing to pay all those affected for the right to continue, and those people might be willing to accept it. They might offer to pay everyone to relocate, and those people might accept that. If the dispute can't be resolved in arbitration because the company refuses to do what the victims of their actions like, then REO's might get involved. The other thing you have to keep in mind is that they are a company, and their reputation does tend to matter, and if they are seen as being very irresponsible and destroying peoples property, people may choose not to fund their business and favor someone who is more conscious of the externalities they create. This is where a market for consumer reporting agencies would be very profitable. The point is is that people in that society have numerous options to solve those problems voluntarily and peacefully, where the state not only takes recourse from them by capping liability, but it limits the scope of the meaningful actions they can take to resolve the problem.

Street lights and schools are easy and obvious problems to solve. Companies are very likely to build roads to their businesses since they have an incentive to have people have a way to get to their business to send money. They would probably maintain the street lights, or whoever the road builder is.

"Part 2 of 2

Schools are another case of an institution that has kind of become a statist development. In reality, with people no longer having four months of labor or more taken from them through some form of taxation, people would likely be working less and have more time to spend with their kids, or have more money to spend on selecting a school of their choice. But even if you aren't sending your kids to a school this does not mean they won't have access to education. This is another problem that technology solves. Computers and internet are getting cheap and ubiquitous enough that even those in the lowest socioeconomic brackets have access to these tools. Sites like [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org) make getting a K-College education a trivial matter. There are tons of sites and resources that make access to knowledge a simple and rewarding endeavor. What you won't have is an institution forcing people to have to send their kids to a specific school based on their zip code such that the wealthy (who can afford to pick up and move to whatever school district they wish to send their kids to) will have access to choice in schooling and the poor (who are less likely to be able to move to where they would like to send their kids to school) who will have very little access to quality education, while still being forced to pay for the inadequate services they are receiving. 

This is getting kind of lengthy, and if you've stuck with me this long, I'd like to just sum up. The problem with the idea that you can use aggression to solve problems will only leave you with more, complex problems to solve. The state is not a good model for creating incentives for people to cooperate and solve problems on a voluntary basis and it will march society into an ever decaying destruction of wealth and instability. It might start out great, but there is nothing but dysfunction to come from the use of aggression to solve problems. You are correct in saying that there are no other models that are perfect, but holding out for a perfect system while you are attached to a system that is just crumbling is a foolish and quixotic endeavor. You will never find the right politicians and get the right people in government because it's not the people in government who are the problem (although they contribute their own flavor of problems) it's the system that is flawed. It's the implications that the system lead to that are unfavorable. If you believe that man is inherently bad and therefore needs to be governed, then where are these angels that will come govern us. If you are so concerned about how bad man can be, then why would you ever advocate for a system that would enable man to possess control over other men on a non-voluntary basis?",eitauisunity,2013-06-09 03:01:19
So what about a revolution where everyone (or many people) simply refused to pay or file taxes?,redhq,2013-06-08 07:00:23
"That's exactly what I am talking about, but the problem with a coordinated ""tax revolt"" is that, one: most people not only have an incentive to file, but have an incentive to not evade. It's quite unsafe to evade taxes en mass at this point (technology can fix this); and two: whoever piped up to be the organizers of that revolt would certainly disappear. 

But withholding your taxes from the state is not sufficient enough. The biggest problem of when states collapse is the ""power vacuum"" that creates conditions for a new state to crop up. From my understanding of history, the reason why this occurs is because some trends about how states are typically structured, and how they fall. Most states throughout history establish compliance by insinuating itself in the necessary supply chains for society. Historically, the supply chains for food and water, more modernly waste management, energy, dispute resolution, law enforcement, fire protection, medical care, etc. When a state collapses and those supply chains go along with it, people start to starve and chaos ensues because when the state existed, at least people had access to food and water, and now that the state has collapsed, people are killing each other over a potato. People see the chaos and assume that it was *because* there is an absence of a state, so there is an opportunity for a new state to be established. Of course, this is a historically violent and bloody process, but people perceive this as being necessary and worth it because before we had things work when the state was around, and now that we have no state ""anarchy"" is conflated with chaos. What is really happening is just an engineering problem. It is a mechanical result of how the state was structured. To fix this, you simply need to rebuild those supply chains independently of the current ones, and beyond the grasp of the state. That is to say, you have to not only make it safe and easy to evade taxes, but you have to make it safe and easy to engage in unlicensed commerce. This is where I think the open source movement will be wholly profound with moving away from the state. I myself am working on a project to design various commercial grade, modular, open source cnc machines with inexpensive designs and open source software. I think making those things ubiquitous will bring us strides forward with becoming independent of the state. That coupled with technology like the deep net, and bitcoin and the success of the silk road, I think unlicensed commerce and tax evasion will become quite safe and easy.

As far as food goes, again, this is where open source will bolster independence from the state: aquaponics. Many of those designs are open source, and when you have an open source community, you are effectively distributing the engineering costs through a market process which makes things very accessible and eventually, very good quality.

If you want to be a revolutionary, worry not about taking up arms; instead, pick up engineering as a hobby, watch khanacademy videos on math and science, learn how to code and develop any other skills that might be handy in developing these technologies.

You are so worried about a nearly impossible situation arising that you would prefer to live in a dystopia where our government has no way of protecting us against foreign enemies.

And I wasn't specifically trying to just say video, I was giving an example of how impossible it is to go through every piece of information.

"It's not about you. It's about the government.

The question at hand is not whether *you* care that your information is being gathered by the government. The question is whether *the government* should be gathering information wholesale.

Recall that ""knowledge is power"". And power that can be used for good can also be used for evil. Never mind that terrorism is responsible for an insignificant number of deaths in the world—information that can be used to stop crime can also be used to profile people that ""oppose the government"".

Don't be so naive as to think that this information will not be abused. These kinds of overreaches have happened time and time again in human history, and almost each time they do, it ends up enabling a totalitarian regime.

It's not about *you*, or the terrorists. It's about allowing the *government* to act like a terrorist, against its own citizens.

They came for the terrorists, and I applauded their commitment to this country and respect to my loved ones who died from terrorist activities.

Then they came for more terrorists, because the rest of that quote is bs fear-mongering that is the lone argument as to why people think this is wrong. Stop using the slippery slope argument and come up with a real one, it's just lazy.",goblue21,2013-06-08 09:31:51
"I sincerely hope that your naiveté is due to your youth, and not a lack of education, and that you will have the opportunity to learn better wisdom as you age.

A slippery slope argument is not ""absurd"" in this case, because history has proven it correct time and time again. For thousands of years, governments have overreached their surveillance powers in the name of ""public safety"". Virtually every time, it has ended in a totalitarian state. Decades later, after countless civil rights have been trampled on, and innocent lives destroyed, and public institutions dismantled, people realize what fools they had been to let the first steps go unchecked…and then the next generation makes the same mistake again.

Hitler's Germany. Mussolini's Italy. Stalin's Russia. Mao's China. Myanmar's military regime. The Roman Caesars. Suharto's Indonesia. McCarthyism in America. History is replete with examples. What makes this period in time any different?

""Terrorist activities"" is a bogeyman. Thousands more people die from french fries and cigarettes each year than from terrorists, yet we don't have a surveillance program against greasy foods. ""Terrorist activities"" is yet another excuse for government overreach.",smeezy,2013-06-08 10:40:21

This conviction that we are not a real democracy. It is truly sad to see so much of the youth caught up in this strain of thought, convinced that they are not in control of their government.

You say this surveillance always ends in a totalitarian state, but every example you put forth is quite the opposite. All of those started as a totalitarian state and used their power of surveillance to control. This IS different because the US is not even close to a totalitarian state. It is still a democratic republic that uses its surveillance to protect not oppress. The slippery slope argument is in fact absurd in this instance because there is ABSOLUTELY NO evidence to suggest that this information is being used in any other way than to prevent terrorist activities. All your examples were to keep tabs on the citizens of those countries. This doesn't even target US citizens! That alone just destroys every argument you've made.

And anyone that just treats terrorism as if it is not a legitamate problem shows how naive they are. This younger generation doesn't seem to truly understand that 9/11 actually happened and the consequences of that event. We need policy to make sure that NEVER happens again. It is absolutely not acceptable to just say ""shit like that happens. more people died from car accidents anyways"". Shit like that does not just happen. It is not inevitable. And with the right actions it can be prevented. I knew people that died that day, and it is not fair to just say this kind of thing happens.

"&gt;This attitude that the government is out to get you. That it is not here to protect you but to protect itself. This conviction that we are not a real democracy.

Your wholehearted faith in the government is…quaint. And unjustified, for one simple fact: the government is made of people. While the majority of players in the government are benign if not benevolent, there exists in the government—just as there exists everywhere else—a minority but malignant population that are out to control and wrest power if given the opportunity.

You appear to believe without question that there are terrorists out there trying to harm innocent civilians. So, what is it about the US government that makes the institution immune to the same human flaws? Is there some magical force field that keep evil people out of the government?

&gt;You say this surveillance always ends in a totalitarian state, but every example you put forth is quite the opposite. All of those started as a totalitarian state and used their power of surveillance to control.

Right, because Germany and Italy were totalitarian states before Hitler and Mussolini came into power. Remember that Rome was a Republic long before the Caesars wrested power.

Totalitarian states don't appear in a vacuum. They haven't always existed. They *come into power*. And overarching surveillance is one of the common tools that are used to bring this about.

&gt;The slippery slope argument is in fact absurd in this instance because there is ABSOLUTELY NO evidence to suggest that this information is being used in any other way than to prevent terrorist activities.

You are right—there is *no* evidence that this information is being used for anything other than good. But then again, two days ago, there was *no* evidence that the government was culling information from every cell phone call made on Verizon.

There will be no evidence of abuse until there is evidence of abuse. That doesn't mean abuse is not likely. And when we learn of such abuse some time in the future—what will you be able to do about it?

&gt;This doesn't even target US citizens!

Wrong. Did you read [the text of the court order?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order) It says:

&gt;IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, the Custodian of Records shall produce to the National Security Agency (NSA)…on an ongoing daily basis…all call detail records…for communications (i) between the United States and abroad; or (ii)**wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.**

And to add to the irony, the court order actually *excludes* communications that originate and terminate wholly outside the US.

Sorry, my friend, the NSA is collecting information *on US citizens*. I don't know how you would interpret this court order in any other way.

Now, on to terrorism...

&gt;We need policy to make sure that NEVER happens again.

At what cost? At *any* cost? Let's just ground *all* aircraft. Let's never allow immigration to occur; let's shut down our borders. *Then* will you feel safe?

Life is risky. Terrorism is just one of those events that might kill you, just like murders, drunk drivers, and stray bullets entering your home. You can't just single out one risk and make it so important that we are willing to give up our Fourth Amendment rights to mitigate. Especially when the risk of death from terrorism is so minuscule.

I have to admit I was wrong—you refer to people as ""youth"", so you're probably an older person, not a young one. Your romantic notions about a benevolent and rational government may be based on nostalgia rather than fact.

Before you make an argument that the US government has our best interest at heart, I would invite you to explain the phenomena of McCarthyism, the internment of Japanese US Citizens, the international Drug Wars, the Iran-Contra affair, and numerous other overreaches of this enlightened government.

""The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.""",,2013-06-08 10:24:17

"The problem with US right now is that we need a rallying cry.  Everyone for the most part knows that over the last decade or so our privacy has continuously been eroded, and the people have allowed it with little more than occasional lip service to the dangers of allowing the government to have this much power.  Part of the reason is an effective fear campaign, and the ever present specter of terrorism.  However, the more significant reason is that we haven't found some relatable universal figure to rally around to help spur action.

For instance most people on reddit have seen at one point or another the TIL about Rosa Parks not being the first person to not give up her seat on a bus. Instead, she was simply the one the NAACP groomed to be the ""face"" of the movement because of her background and reliability at the time. If we want to fight for our privacy that is what we need.  We need an organization that is willing to put significant time into planning a response.  We need an individual with a good, relatable background to put him/herself squarely in the crosshairs of these policies and market the hell out the case that arises.  We have to be willing to sacrifice and fight otherwise the government has no reason to hear our concerns.  We can't simply hear the news, get outraged, and go back to business as usual. We have carry that outrage into action, and people have to be willing to risk it all to take back what our forefathers earned.",MDMaholic,2013-06-08 07:20:22
"If Anne Frank were writing a blog, she and her family would be dead before her third post. (Just shift the technology by 80 years, maybe Leonardo da Vinci survived another 10 years and manifested the steam engine.)

Who needs yellow stars sewn on Jews' clothing? Who needs to guess who's gay? Who needs to guess who's Japanese? There's a computer farm listening to ALL phone conversations in real time. Software listens for anyone speaking Yiddish, Japanese, saying, ""Oy vey"", or quoting the Torah, sexting between men, pillow talk between wymen. The computers automatically dispatch a carload of goons directly to the victim, as they have their head bent over, neck exposed for the knife already, talking into a radio transmitter pinpointing their location with Global Positioning Satellites betraying their location at all times. Get them all in concentration camps.

How many Jews and Roma and gay men and women would Internet-Hitler with an electronic Gestapo have killed?... ALL. OF. THEM. How many Americans of Japanese descent and Japanese and German immigrants would FDR have rounded up and stolen their homes, businesses, and lives?... ALL.OF.THEM.

Imagine Stalin and Mao having the ability to silently turn on the cameras and microphones *voluntarily carried in people's pants*, in their laptops, to listen in on EVERY conversation, see EVERY photo, and sift them with computers.

What would the herd of cattle do when they saw the cowboys ride over the ridge-line *IF* the cattle knew, not only of the corral, of the truck ride, and saw in their future, not only troughs filled with delicious grain, but knew about the last chute, and the captive-bolt in their brains? The cattle would go stomp them some Marlboro(tm) men, that's what they'd do.

When I was a kid, my dad had a tennis instructor from Romania. I recall now visiting their home for dinner, and hearing bewildering stories of them closing their blinds, unplugging their phone, and whispering about the good old days, and which of their neighbors were spying and reporting on them, and their friends who ""disappeared"". They still sat at their dinner table in 1970's Wisconsin talking in hushed tones.

Is that our future? Unplug the modem. Unplug the router. Take the batteries out of the laptops and phones. Find an interior room to avoid the laser-listeners at our windows. Let's whisper about the good old days when we were ""free"", and wonder which of our neighbors is going to turn us in to meet a quota.

Are you going to get a knock on your door in 20 years, from someone who knows you read this post? Who may know you hit the ""Up Arrow"" for 20 minutes, then un-liked it out of fear. Do you know more? Do you talk to your friends about this post (silly, we already know, we're just testing you). Why did you not denounce this post, Citizen? Are you loyal to Uncle Sam?

Tyrannies LOVE catalogs of their victims. Will future U.N. archaeologists be able to catalog entire killing fields, trenches of bodies, and pyramids of skulls with one grad student in 15 minutes, what with the RFID tags future-despots will use on the bodies? They won't even need a shovel, and the computer will auto-dispatch condolences to the family. Unless, of course, it determines the entire family is deceased.

"As a non-American, a massive and powerful foreign government has the ability to monitor my Internet activity and flag me as a national security risk to your country, which has nothing to do with my own safety whatsoever. To make matters worse, your President, the most powerful person in the entire world, justified ignoring the rights that my own Government gave me but now cannot protect (thanks to your Government), by telling me that I'm a foreigner and since I'm not American my privacy regarding the Internet is completely non-existant. And while all this is happening, I cannot do a single thing to aid in the removal of the PRISM program, or help to make sure that hypocritical and ethically inferior candidates such as Mr. Obama who continue programs which trample on our civil liberties never get elected again, because I am not American, even though the sting of these programs damages me moreso than an American.

If you're American and reading this then you're in a position that many angry and frustrated people around the world would like to be in right now. Not only do you have the ability to speak out about this atrocity but you also have a voice that in unison can be listened to. You can either push your own system to win back the much needed civil liberties of people around the world, or you can continue to let your country get away with violating mine, yours and everyones' rights until you're seen as another copy of China, treating their own people as cattle.

Students angry about tuition? They take to the streets, the press will focus on the minority that became violent.

Are you angry about poverty and a lack of jobs? The poorest people take to the streets after the shooting and killing of a man by a police officer. People riot, loot, set things on fire - but mainly they are there to fight the police (who symbolise their oppression and the government, i suppose) the media coverage will be on the looting, it will ask the stupidest people what they are doing, that cannot form a logical answer, just ""i wanna loot"". Never mind that they are looting because they are so poor they couldn't afford the things they take, and this is their chance to get them, never mind what that could say about our country. Never mind that the actual fight was against the police, you will all be construed as rioters, given sentences that are explicitly intended to be set as examples for others including one guy who got 4 weeks for stealing 2 bottles of water - the window of a shop was smashed and he picked a couple off the floor because he was thirsty. Any legitimate concerns will be ignored. All intellectuals of your country, the ones you'd wish would stand up, say something, and get a real campaign with a real message behind them won't do it. Any protests are seen as riots. Expect to be arrested, kettled, or even beaten to death by the police for just walking past at the wrong moment.

That reminds me of what the media focused on during Hurricane Katrina's immediate aftermath. Once the attention died down, I found random articles and videos about people helping each other; encouraging stories about victims assisting those who were in even more dire situations than themselves.

But when the media circus was still in full bloom, very little (if any) of that could be seen. Besides the damage, the coverage was dominated by endless scenes of people taking items from stores, barely intelligible folks being interviewed...

It made me wonder if the news corporations' motives were to broadcast the most sensationalized reports for the sake of views, or if there was some other agenda behind what they chose to focus upon.

"Y'know, I've always been one of those people who hold that 'Brave New World' was the more accurate view than '1984', but the way things are shaping up I'm not so sure anymore.  

A large part of that feeling was that in Brave New World, any of the characters you're introduced to are largely smart, just taught from birth to not care about anything.  These upper castes represented in my mind our general populace today, with technology and pop culture replacing government drugs.  The lowest castes aren't characterized at all.  While this caste system was a bit overly-fictionalized, I thought it was at least more realistic than the idea of an incredibly efficient, spying, ruthless government superpower.  

Your comment reminds me though of the other side of 1984.  That the lower social strata actually do get humanized.  They're controlled, but still living their lives.  I think that the general population today has a lot more in common with the proles singing and hanging laundry in 1984 than the drugged out society of Brave New World.

"America is a very big place with a great many people. You can compare it to Russia. Putin fixes votes and does questionable things, but outside of Moscow and St Petersburg most people don't care. They don't protest. Why? It doesn't affect them. Their life goes on mostly the same regardless of who is in power. They might make a little less money or save a little more money here and there, but it's small fry. They care about their day-to-day and the guy in charge doesn't affect that at all.

It's the same in America. It's spread out. Does some data collection nonsense by the government matter to a guy in rural Kentucky? He doesn't give a fuck, it doesn't affect him, he has nothing to hide anyway he thinks. And if he did care, who would he talk to about it? Who would he protest with? What, he's going to take time off work to fly to a big city and protest *there*? To what end? About a problem that doesn't affect his day-to-day? Sure he could vote, but politicians lie anyway - Obama said he would be open and transparent and respect privacy and he's not. They elected Obama because of a message of hope. How can you blame them for believing in that message? 

In a dense country like the UK, it's easier to travel to London to protest. With the density it's also easier for people to share information and ideas, and for outrage to form. You see this in dense cities in North America, but a lot of people - the voting public - don't live in dense cities.

I absolutely understand that sentiment. I really do. But essentially, decades of political apathy has allowed the US system to get so corrupted by money and lobbyist.

Really? I agree with half of what you're saying, but the other half seems to be based on misguided assumptions about a reality that you do not experience directly.

As an American who vehemently disagrees with most of 'the system' and have since I was a child, and spends most days wishing he was never born for about a thousand reasons, I don't appreciate you telling me how complacent I am and how good I've got it. You don't know shit about me. Open your mind or shut your mouth. Fucking pick one.

I agree though, that people need to be willing to take risks to change things for the better. I am, I have, but I will not throw my life away for nothing when mainstream society will paint me as an anarchist shithead just for disagreeing with the government and nothing will change. Because that is exactly what happens time and again, and until we can convince the majority of idiots out there staring at their TVs that the government isn't really on their side, they won't see things any differently.

Yes, a majority of reddit was enamored with this man and his slightly less obvious flip flopping, and his media pandered other issues swept under the rug. This has more to say with people being blind to the actual issue, which is that elections have been rigged for a while, nothing has been in their control, and they are essentially buying into the propaganda that they prefer best.

That said, you can't blame them for trusting a government that has controlled their education almost entirely. A government that has ensured that not only Orwellian, but other communist and fascist ideals are made the norm in their curriculum. A government that has, and continues to breed, a generation that are so afraid of associating with guns, because it can land you in more trouble talking about guns, than actual gun related violence as an adult. 

No, none of that is to blame, none of the misinformation, and the propaganda is to blame.

"You seem to have a woefully simple understanding of ""representatives"" in a representative democracy.

Those who have been elected to positions of political authority have been groomed by countless other institutions and private powers. Tethered to our ""representatives"" are enormously powerful lobby groups, influential private entities, the military, and capital itself. To confront one is to confront them all, and it will require an enormously broadbased movement to do so successfully.

People of the world are realizing this though. The connections between capital, lobby groups, and the state are becoming increasingly apparent. The abuses of power of even the most apparently benign politician are becoming less taboo to discuss, and people are growing increasingly ready to move against what ails them.

Reveals like this do not demonstrate the shortcomings of Americans, it demonstrates the necessity of future organizing. It will take time to break the institutionalized complacency among the majority of the American population. The Cold War, the War on Terror, and relative affluence have certainly taken their toll, but you're way out of line thinking that the average US citizen has a hand in any of this.",broletariado,2013-06-07 23:01:42

"The political system in the United States is functionally exactly as it was designed. The Founding Fathers of the US were the victorious parties in a bourgeois revolution against a colonial power. They sought  the readjustment of political and economic legitimacy from overseas empire to local ruling class, and that is exactly what they achieved.

The electorate system hasn't changed since the country's inception. It was specifically designed to marginalize the poor. Originally this was done in more obvious and coercive ways: the nation's founders maintained the idea that some men were property, and others (those who did not own land, women, etc) would not be able to exercise political agency. 

As generations came and went material conditions have changed drastically. What hasn't changed was the explicit efforts by the founding fathers of this country to ensure that the power of the ruling elite has not ebbed in any way. 

When the public finally lashes out against the state and seizes power it will not be setting right the foundational principles of this country. It will be finally rejecting the trajectory that this country has been on since its inception and setting an entirely new course.",broletariado,2013-06-08 00:39:05

The average american still at least **seems** to be a stupid and religious gun fanatic who thinks his goverment and country is Number 1.

"It does seem that the average american is like that. Part of the reason is that the idealistic and sane people like the majority on Reddit are the least likely to vote. The ignorant and religious are easily bought by campaigns focused on values that fit theirs(even if the person running for office fails to uphold any of those values). The corporations hold a lot of power because of this tactic. They can pour enormous amounts of money into campaigns through stealthy means and practically buy elections. The corruption of representatives is rampant. Most of the corruption is still unknown to the common people because of how well done it is. In some areas, our vote can count, and not all representatives are corrupt and might listen to their constituency. Also, the representatives can change their view on topics once they are in office. We have little way of knowing which candidate choice is the correct one. People can hide behind a facade very easily. It's not impossible to change the system, but with a population of over 300 million, it's nearly impossible to achieve a majority. Even if the change is tried in a smaller area, getting many people to agree enough is very difficult. 

We are lazy and complacent, but it is still a tremendous task to undertake. Also, it's hard to create a solution that is feasible. How do we alter the system to allow for more checks in the process? How do we keep the ignorance of the people from choosing candidates that will harm us? The variety of views hold us back. The US is too split up in its views on major topics to choose wisely. We have to choose between a couple of horrible alternatives.

""What the ...?

Posted: Friday, June 07, 2013    
Dear Google users—

You may be aware of press reports alleging that Internet companies have joined a secret U.S. government program called PRISM to give the National Security Agency direct access to our servers. As Google’s CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts.

First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. government—or any other government—direct access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a “back door” to the information stored in our data centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.

Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don’t follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users’ data are false, period. Until this week’s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users’ call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users’ Internet activity on such a scale is completely false. 

Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believed—there needs to be a more transparent approach. Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive. We post this information on our Transparency Report whenever possible. We were the first company to do this. And, of course, we understand that the U.S. and other governments need to take action to protect their citizens’ safety—including sometimes by using surveillance. But the level of secrecy around the current legal procedures undermines the freedoms we all cherish.

Lilly Library Manuscript Collections:
&gt;The United World Federalists mss., 1928-1988 (bulk 1946-1986), are the inactive office files of the United World Federalists. This organization was founded in Asheville, North Carolina on February 23, 1947 as the result of a merger of five existing world government groups: Americans United for World Government; World Federalists, U.S.A.; Student Federalists; Georgia World Citizens Committee; and the Massachusetts Committee for World Federation. In the mid-1970s it adopted its present name of World Federalist Association.
&gt;
&gt;The World Federalist Association is a non-partisan, non-profit organization with members in forty-eight states. It has 350 chapters in thirty-nine states, a chapter in Hawaii and state-wide branches in twenty-seven states. The primary purpose of the organization is: (1) **to achieve permanent peace through universal disarmament enforced by law**; (2) to release for the satisfaction of human needs the resources that at present must be used in continuous preparation for war; (3) to maintain and promote human freedom, and to mobilize support for free institutions among all peoples; (4) to secure to all peoples the right to develop according to their own customs and traditions. Based entirely in the United States it is one of the largest member organizations of the World Federalist Movement. While the two organizations work closely together on many programs they are incorporated separately, with separate staffs, headquarters, and governing boards.
&gt;
&gt;The collection consists of correspondence and internal memoranda; records relating to the United World Federalists's history, organization, policies and programs, committee reports, student chapters, general assemblies held annually in different cities; financial accounts and membership records; and manuals and other publications issued by the national office on a variety of issues. In addition there are scrapbooks, audio tapes, films and phonograph albums. The arrangement and contents of the files have been retained and listed as received. Box/folder lists are available:

It means the UN would be the federal government of the Earth.  Like the Federal Government is to the USA.  I am not making this up either.  This is what they say.  Just like Scientologists believe in Xenu.  Which might not be so bad (a world government) but they keep getting caught lying, stealing, spying and doing bad things.

He wrote in his book about his ideas for a world government (he called it a planetary regime) and 'forced abortions', placing chemicals into the water supply to make people sterile, spraying particulates into the air to block out the sun.  [You can read the whole book online](http://archive.org/details/Ecoscience_17).

Quote from Ecoscience written by Obama's Science Czar John P Holdren (I say Obama's because he was appointed by Obama):

&gt;Should a Law of the Sea be successfully established, it could serve as a model for a future Law 
&gt;of the Atmosphere to regulate the use of airspace, to monitor climate change, and to control 
&gt;atmospheric pollution. Perhaps those agencies, combined with UNEP and the United Nations 
&gt;population agencies, might eventually be developed into a Planetary Regime — sort of an 
&gt;international superagency for population, resources, and environment. Such a comprehensive 
&gt;Planetary Regime could control the development, administration, conservation, and distribution 
&gt;of all natural resources, renewable or nonrenewable, at least insofar as international implications 
&gt;exist. Thus, the Regime could have the power to control pollution not only in the atmosphere and 
&gt;the oceans, but also in such freshwater bodies as rivers and lakes that cross international 
&gt;boundaries or that discharge into the oceans. The Regime might also be a logical central agency 
&gt;for regulating all international trade, perhaps including assistance from DCs to LDCs, and 
&gt;including all food on the international market.

"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57588337-38/no-evidence-of-nsas-direct-access-to-tech-companies/

&gt;The National Security Agency has not obtained direct access to the systems of Apple, Google, Facebook, and other major Internet companies, CNET has learned.
&gt;
&gt;Recent reports in the Washington Post and the Guardian claimed a classified program called PRISM grants ""intelligence services direct access to the companies' servers"" and that ""from inside a company's data stream the NSA is capable of pulling out anything it likes.""
&gt;
&gt;Those reports are incorrect and appear to be based on a misreading of a leaked Powerpoint document, according to a former government official who is intimately familiar with this process of data acquisition and spoke today on condition of anonymity.
&gt;
&gt;""It's not as described in the histrionics in the Washington Post or the Guardian,"" the person said. ""None of it's true. It's a very formalized legal process that companies are obliged to do.""
&gt;
&gt;That former official's account -- that the process was created by Congress six years ago and includes judicial oversight -- was independently confirmed by another person with direct knowledge of how this data collection happens at multiple companies.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;The legal process, the person said, is akin to how law enforcement request information in criminal investigations: the government delivers an order to obtain account details about someone who's specifically identified as a non-U.S. individual, with a specific finding that they're involved in an activity related to international terrorism. Both the contents of communications and metadata, such as information about who's talking to whom, can be requested.",ThouHastLostAn8th,2013-06-08 00:57:04

I've learned to be judicious in the causes I take up, because the validity of each individual cause defines the validity of my general struggle.

Relevant lying/propaganda quotes by Hitler, Geobbels, and Goering (many of them I've heard and are fairly certain are true, but I'm not certain of all). Relevant in the whole, ""because of 9/11 and the war, Americans need their government for security"" milieu that's been taking over. 

""Why of course the people don't want war. Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally the common people don't want war neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."" -Goering

""It also gives us a very special, secret pleasure to see how unaware the people around us are of what is really happening to them."" -Hitler

""The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State."" -Goebbels

The answer is nobody *really* knows.

I did notice that nobody denied the PRISM leak was true.  But that's just how they play the game, so maybe it means nothing.  

We are examining an issue where the quality of evidence is itself at issue.  The NSA is just that kind of organization that manipulates signals, manipulates evidence, constructs and deploys decoys and facades.

Before, i thought that an impeachment of the president of the USA is the least that should happen in such a case.

But the next day, I thought that global trade embargo's are a reasonable response to such a global act of espionage, and demanding the responsible state representatives and presidents to be removed by all countries of the united nations at least.

If you allow and promote espionage on such a huge scale you can be lucky if half of the world does not declare war on you at once.

"That is something I honestly could not answer. I was not alive during the Vietnam war. 

I do think I have a theory though. Since the '70s, there have become a greater number of ways to distract people. In the '60s and '70s there weren't hundreds of television channels or the internet as well for that matter. What was broadcasted in mainstream media was the Vietnam War. Real life videos of soldiers suffering and live combat. Now most of those videos have been censored by FCC and cannot be publicized to show the atrocities of war. Not to blame video games for violence, but they have created a sense of numbness to the real pain that can occur. You die in the game, and you respawn; no harm, no foul. From my experience as well, the younger generation seems to avoid politics all together and probably couldn't even name our three branches of government despite having a bachelor's degree.

To sum most of it up: Distractions and ignorance are one of the main reasons, along with the censorship of mainstream media.

This is one more reason why corporations are allowed to get away with so much.   If I recall Qwest had refused to comply with this stuff back during the Bush administration and the CEO Joseph Nacchio was brought up on insider trading charges.  Had he complied perhaps that wouldn't have happened.   When persons comply with unconstitutional secret requests then those individuals become immune to prosecution for other illegal activity as each has something on the other that neither wants revealed.   It's likely the administration already has information on certain individuals high up in corporations and uses that as leverage to get them to comply.,fishlover,2013-06-08 00:48:38

"""The long term solution is that Europe should have a dot.com industry just like the United States, which would give us economic benefits but more importantly would make us independent of the wholesale surveillance of the U.S intelligence agencies.""

Europe has been totally left behind by the internet revolution, The Only companies of any significant importance are in the US, with Japan and South Korea trailing far behind. Europe doesn't even have the proper tech manufacturing infrastructure to create such a network, what are they gonna do create a net run on what companies Huwaei,and Cisco? Their is no European equivalent, at least not one who can handle such a network which has already been put into place by its American counterparts..Europe doesn't even have their 4G network fully integrated continent wide yet, not to mention they have fallen so far behind on internet based cell phone technology.

From anti-GMO hysteria (which began with the German conglomerate Bayer struggling to cope with loss of herbicide revenues with the introduction of Monsanto's Roundup-Ready crops), to hypocritically ignoring world trade laws (EADS anyone?). Every time the EU finds itself unable to compete with Americans, they resort to these dirty tricks to try to cover for their losses.

And along comes this completely unsubstantiated claim. Well, to the EU, any unsubstantiated claim of US wrongdoing is ""concrete proof"" that you should start conducting business with EU companies.

Americans secretly don't trust their government. 
It only takes one or two public 'betrayals' before they want to crucify their own figurehead, even if he is placed (and controlled) by congress. Know who rules, know who has the real power.  

They value freedom to the point where their own government are their oppressors. Americans value 'Freedom' as a hollow construction so deeply in their psyche, they will over-react to protect any possibility of infringing upon it. Furthermore they discount the fact that privacy is now shifting to become a thing of the past, data-mining or not. 

Governments from a macro-view have the security of the people at heart and in focusing on that they lose the micro-view in the process. To them, the loss of privacy (which has already been slowly happening since the advent of the digital age, to no-one's outrage) isn't a big deal compared to the threat of attacks from an external and internal source. I don't believe that the government is out to form some totalitarian regime, that's the fanning of the flames by those conspiracy theorists and paranoid distrust of the government.

&gt;It is possible to work backwards to recreate individual aspects of the technology, but the men who knew how the whole vehicle worked are gone. No one alive today is able to recreate the Saturn V as it was.

&gt;Worse is the lack of records. Without a planned used for the Saturn V after Apollo, most of the comprehensive records of the rockets inner workings stayed with the engineers. Any plans or documents explaining the inner workings of the completed rocket that remain are possibly living in someone’s basement, unknown and lost in a pile of a relative’s old work papers.

&gt;Two Saturn Vs remain today as museum pieces, but it is likely that the rocket will never see a rebirth and reuse in manned spaceflight.

&gt;Yes, NASA put men on the moon with 1960s technology, but that technology doesn’t exist anymore. By default, neither does the possibility of a manned lunar or Martian mission for that matter without a new launch vehicle.

"It's an unmanned mission with multiple (32 to 48) close flybys that would achieve the same science objectives set out in the decadal* as the Europa orbiter in the now defunct  NASA/ESA EJSM-Laplace mission would have.

EJSM would cost $4.7b, EC would cost $2.1b (not including launch vehicle costs). It also have the benefit of strong congressional support (from the GOP in particular), and the incoming chair of the House's Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) appropriations subcommittee is a strong proponent of exploring Europa. As for the ESA part of EJSM, that's going to be JUICE.

"LEO, minimum requirements, blocks.

Thank you.",GiantDuarf,2014-12-03 20:39:35
"**LEO** is Low Earth Orbit, where the ISS and Hubble are. Rockets are usually said to be able to lift a specific mass to LEO. This makes it easy to compare the capability of different rockets. For example, the Saturn V could lift 118 metric tons to LEO, and the Falcon 9 can lift approximately 13 tons to LEO.

The **minimum requirements** were decided by Congress, and are the minimum capabilities (again in payload to LEO) that they want SLS to have.

The specific wording is as follows:

&gt;
MINIMUM CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Space Launch System developed
pursuant to subsection (b) shall be designed to have, at a
minimum, the following:
(A) The initial capability of the core elements, without
an upper stage, of lifting payloads weighing between 70
tons and 100 tons into low-Earth orbit in preparation for
transit for missions beyond low-Earth orbit.
(B) The capability to carry an integrated upper Earth
departure stage bringing the total lift capability of the
Space Launch System to 130 tons or more.
(C) The capability to lift the multipurpose crew vehicle.
(D) The capability to serve as a backup system for
supplying and supporting ISS cargo requirements or crew
delivery requirements not otherwise met by available
commercial or partner-supplied vehicles.

**Blocks** are part of the SLS's stepwise development. Instead of developing and building the final rocket in one go (which would be too costly in the current budget environment)  NASA (and Congress) decided to start out with a 70t rocket and evolve it to 130t. That way NASA can fly missions with the initial configurations whilst developing the Advanced Boosters and Upper Stages needed to get to the 130t requirement.

The Blocks are:

* Block 1, consisting of an extended shuttle external tank and 5 segment solid rocket boosters and no upper stage. (The shuttle used 4 segment SRB's)

* Block 1A, the same as Block 1 except it has [advanced boosters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System#Advanced_boosters) (currently planned to be decided by a competition)

* Block 1B, the same extended core and SRB's as Block 1 but with and exploration upper stage.

* Block 2 has both the advanced boosters and the upper stage.

The original plan was to start with Block 1 and then evolve to Block 1A and finally get to Block 2 somewhere around 2030, but the current plan will have NASA go with Block 1B from the second mission. But from what I've read the guys at Marshall Spaceflight Center are hoping to get as close to the 130 ton requirement as possible without the advanced boosters in the hope that Congress will consider it good enough and invest the money that would have gone into the boosters into missions and payloads. Which seems sensible to me.",DetlefKroeze,2014-12-03 21:38:22

"They're not going to launch it straight to Mars. The current plan is to assemble the Mars-ship in either Earth orbit or at a station located at one of the Lagrange points.

"this is great info. thanks. I will be reading this all morning. 

I do have to say that I love that the idea of a second block ( block 2 ) may be scrapped for the other idea of block 1a and block 1b, which is obviously not two blocks, because they are both separately part of the first. ",imawookie,2014-12-04 05:23:20

"What are the practical differences in this case? I know the simpler vs more controllable, etc debate but have a hard time putting it in context. ",Mythrilfan,2014-12-04 00:23:22
"Are you talking about liquid versus solid? Liquid boosters allows for throttling, which makes it much safer (eg, it can be shut down if something wrong happens). Solid boosters work like fireworks, in which it will continue to burn no matter what, so it's extremely dangerous if something goes wrong (like the Challenger disaster). The main advantage with solid boosters is that it provides a lot more thrust compared to any liquid booster. They also tend to be comparatively cheaper. Liquid boosters tend to be more efficient, which means they can burn for longer. This is advantageous in vacuum (ie space), where air resistance and gravitational effects are much lower, so you don't need high levels of thrust to counteract those effects. 

Personally, I'm hoping for the F-1B booster (shown in Ptolemy48's picture) for the SLS, which is a liquid booster that uses a modified Saturn V engine. That's projected to improve the LEO capability of the SLS to 150 tons, which would open up a tremendous deal of possibilities. Also, having heavy-lift liquid fuel engines once again won't hurt. ",Dtnoip30,2014-12-04 02:43:50
"That's just the initial Block I variant.  The Block II variant will be bigger than the V and can carry more to low earth orbit.

",Uberzwerg,2014-12-04 01:33:52
"Money and development time. If NASA develops all the parts for the 130t version in one go they will end up starving the development budget and delaying the program. If they develop the rocket in stages (Core Stage -&gt; Large Upper Stage -&gt; Advanced Boosters) they can use the intermediate 105t (the [current plans](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/06/nasa-confirms-eus-sls-block-ib-design-em-2-flight/) have NASA go with the LUS from Exploration Mission 2 onwards) to fly missions whilst the advanced boosters needed to increase the capacity to 130t are being developed.

But from what I've heard the engineers are hoping to get as close to the 130t requirement as possible in the hope that Congress will consider it 'close enough' and invest the money that would have gone into the boosters in the missions and payloads instead.

"Cutting the military is a favorite target for those who like to play games with the federal budget.  The problem is that money will be spent or not spent based on other purposes and it still doesn't come up with political support necessary for something like space exploration.  Shaving that 0.5% from the DOD is only going to get it dumped into some VA hospital, a new highway, or some flood control project instead.  There are a whole lot of other places that have much more political support.

You also have people like oceanographers, climate researchers, physicists, and others who are also clamoring for scientific funding and claiming space exploration is a waste of time where their pet science projects deserve better funding as well.  Projects like the Superconducting Supercollider were put up against the ISS and lost... with a whole lot of angry scientists ticked off at NASA over that hapening.  The politics here is pretty brutal and not so simple as those advocating ""Penny for NASA"" seem to be implying.

I also think the whole approach that they are taking is utterly naive and ineffective for several other reasons, particularly as it isn't really getting at the grassroots level of support and really only interested in supporting robotic missions to space too.

https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/45010-Outlook2014_Feb_0.pdf

This seems to indicate that welfare costs about 340 billion while discretionary defense funding exceeds 600 billion (not including military pensions and benefits which are near 150 billion).

Higher education is actually a net mandatory inlay of about 7 billion (profit not loss). Education, training, and social services combined discretionary spending is only 90 billion, far shy of defense spending.",jawaiah,2014-12-04 01:35:41

"That's a incredibly over generalized viewpoint. Stadiums work if a couple of things are looked after. 1. The business owners pay for around 50% of the total cost. The total cost includes land acquisition (eminent domain etc)  and development,   transportation infrastructure and revitalization projects things that are usually taken care of by municipalities since they are the people we pay to do these things anyway, as well as the stadium itself which would be picked up by the owners.  although tax cuts would be justified to absorb some risk in certain situations it doesn't have to be used in a free money way.
2. It is placed in areas near developed land but in sections that need to be redeveloped or have been left undeveloped.
3. focus heavily on redeveloping the area around the city in a fair manner . 
A stadium isn't going to make money outright for the government and that's not the point, the point is to generate growth and business in the area while increasing the now developed land value that the city owns which they can sell back at a later date to developers.

Stadiums are a nice tool to get people to care about going to a dead area in a robust town but problems arise when smaller towns without the pulling power of a bigger metro area compete for those teams and dig themselves into a hole.",jdacheifs0,2014-12-03 20:17:40

"Actually, I think that the space race is fundamental.

I am not a nationalist at all, but I do think that when the governments feel the pressure, they put more money and resources in the space, which is important.

Without the space race during the cold war, probably nobody would have put a man in orbit or landed a man in the moon, because it is expensive and *useless*  for the amount of money you have to invest.
It is of course not useless, but I seriously doubt that with the *dick measuring contest* of the US and the URSS, none of those countries would have done the amazing things they did on space.

I think that, sometimes, a bit of competitions is good if it leads to higher investments. If the price for having a man on the moon is that a few Americans feel superior, it is a price I am willing to pay (mostly, because you can ignore them, but the technology will still be real).

On the other hand, I think that the competition should never lead to lack of cooperation. If it is better for all the countries to work together at some point, then it would be stupid to not do it just because we want to be the first ones.",EonesDespero,2014-12-04 03:46:52

Nearly everything that could possibly go wrong with Philae's landing did (top thruster failure, harpoon failure, ice screw failure) and it still landed intact, semi-usable and capable of returning meaningful data (although not in the long term and with limited functionality).  

Try to land on Mars without working engines and properly functioning attitude control and you end up with a multi-billion dollar crater with a bunch of shiny bits and some radioactive isotopes scattered around it and a visible NASA logo if you're lucky.",QuothTheHaven,2014-12-04 07:53:00

"&gt;Why are people downvoting you? Apparently landing on a comet, which was a precedent, isn't a notable achievement.

"NASA has safely landed on Mars, Jupiter, Venus, the moon,  and an asteroid, insinuating that they couldn't figure out how to slowly land on a comet doesn't make sense. They were able to examine 90+ feet into a comet vs Rosetta's centimeters.

"I am insinuating NASA has not yet landed on a comet, or orbited a comet. That's simply a fact. There is some science that could be done with Deep Impact that Rosetta cannot do, and vice-versa. ",tsk05,2014-12-04 08:37:27
"Not only did it land on the comet, it created a 98 foot deep crater that was examined by the spacecraft that launched it and the Rosetta spacecraft that 9 1/2 years later landed on another comet with a bit more finesse. NASA was even able to land an orbiter on an asteroid that wasn't even intended for contact with it. It was able to transmit from the surface just like philae did, but for 16 days. The only difference between a comet and an asteroid is that a comet has a visible tail. Japan was able to land on an asteroid for 1 second and return some dust to earth. 

Edit
I'm not trying to say that what the European Space Agency did wasn't groundbreaking. A soft landing has got to be exponentially harder than a hard impact... But to say that NASA doesn't have a lander on a comet and another on an asteroid right now is just wrong.",neogod,2014-12-04 09:33:40
"Impact is not landing. It has its own challenges (like how not to miss a small target at a very high velocity), but it is not a landing. Would you call a car crash into a brick wall parking? And Deep Impact was never in orbit around Tempel 1, it was much much farther than Rosetta on a flyby. It's a very successful mission, especially because it did a lot of science after the primary mission too, but it's not a landing, it wasn't intended to be a landing and NASA does not say it is. By the way, there are a few more differences between a comet and an asteroid than having a tail; if you want to talk about scientific successes I can assure you that people studying those objects would not be very happy with that description. NEAR was a great success, you are correct. Hayabusa was arguably a landing too, also big success. Both of them are asteroids and not comets though. There was a couple of years ago a NASA mission proposed to (in a controlled manner) land on and study multiple places of a comet but it did not get selected, it may be proposed again soon. ",tsk05,2014-12-04 09:45:00
"You're saying that a mission called deep impact, with an impacter consisting of 60% copper dead weight, an orbiter (it did orbit the comet, dropped the impacter in front of it, collected debris on the next pass, then moved off to do other things) with a built in debris shield, was actually meant to land softly on the comet? That's quite a conspiracy.  What about the dictionary definitions of landing and comets? You're car into a brick wall analogy doesn't hold up unless said car got airborne first. Comets and asteroids usually have different proportions of the same materials, and can often be mixed up or even turn into one another.

" Usain bolt may be the fastest man alive, but it doesn't stop others from trying to beat him. This, my friend, is what we call a race. 30 years is a long time...we may be the closest now, but at any second another country could have some crazy miraculous breakthrough. A genius that we do not have, that could turn the tables in an instant. Countries may have technology that they have kept miraculously secret from our prying eyes. There are many possibilities, and we can't risk any of them. We will push for Mars. Others will undoubtedly push for mars even though we currently have the advantage, all the same that countries keep sending in 100M sprinters to the Olympics, despit Usain's prowess.  But a technological race is much different than a physical race. It can gather millions of minds together, whereas with a physical race it all depends on one to 4 people for the most part. 

What the world needs right now is a space race. Let's stop giving a fuck about war. With Mars now as the goal, perhaps Russia will stop giving a fuck about Urkaine, because every resource they spend towards expanding boarders on earth, they lose much more in space. We have expanded the playing field immensely. We landed on the moon first...a comet first...and now Mars? An iconic planet. There have been many novels and movies depicting this one event. The moon was a result of a war. Mars will be a result of pure scientific achievement. This is a race that nobody can afford to lose, and we just shot the gun. The race has begun. 

I myself am thrilled by this news. We just declared our victory. We have no provoked the world. ""Come at us. We will get there in 35 years, when will you get there?"" In reality, however, I suspect that we will get there sooner. 35 years is a projection based on our current technology and projections for technological advancement. With a race many things change.

They probably based it on the real possibility of funds not increasing for NASA. I think some private companies will like to be involved too so some of the cost may be eaten by them.

   I also think funds could increase if we knew they were spent on mars. They decreased in the past decade because the public didn't think NASA was going to do anything with it. They probably assumed, ""they are just going to use the money to put another satellite up there"" which is not glamorous enough. Now that the public knows they are planning a Mars trip for real I think they would be more willing to support it. I am a conservative so this is based on my conservative ideals and if a conservative feels this way liberals are probably already in the bag.

I think the only way NASA's budget will get enough money to get the job done would be if China gets involved. China is already aiming to put a man on the moon. Their lunar program has been very successful so far. Its not going to be very long before there's a Chinese flag raised on the moon. Then after that, China might want to go one step further.

Even aerospace is so far up their own butts, Elon is going to start building his own satellites because he doesn't have enough customers, consuming that industry as well when he was suppose to be it's savior. **Nobody listened** and now they get left behind.

Still though, it's pretty cool. And I think it will all happen (going there, moon base, Mars base, etc.).

Between stupidly hot planets (Mercury), acid planets (Venus), gas giants, frozen-as-fuck planets, etc. (I'm generalizing but you understand) it's pretty sweet that our next door neighbor - even if not habitable at all given today's technology - is one that we can actually land on and walk around on before leaving to come back home.

We've had a 1 ton nuclear powered robotic science tank rolling around on that planet for years. That's ignoring all the previous missions. Our problem isn't the difficulty. We could certainly figure out how to get living people there and back inside a decade. It's that we don't have the will to accept the cost and potential risk of a *serious* program to just go do it. 
  
And so we get these depressing, protracted timelines about ""Decades in the future, when humans might walk on mars."" That should've happened twenty years ago.",DreamerGeek,2014-12-03 19:42:34
"That political will was a direct product of the Cold War, though. NASA, and especially their manned programs, were pretty much an extension of foreign policy for the first couple decades of their existence. 

If you translated the levels of funding the Apollo project got during its life to today's budgets, you'd have NASA getting in the neighborhood of $50+ billion a year compared to the ~$14-18 billion they normally receive. There's pretty much no way in today's domestic political climate that you can sell that amount of public investment in programs that don't provide a lot of direct, immediate benefit to the great majority of people on the ground. Interest in and funding for Apollo dropped quickly after the initial landings for similar reasons.

I say this as someone who loves space exploration and wants to see people land on Mars and hopefully start expanding our presence permanently beyond the Earth in my lifetime. I've devoted a significant amount of my time in recent years to supporting these things. You're right that we could probably overcome the technical challenges, but in the end it's the political and value-based ones that matter and not without reason. The reason the nuclear robotic science tank happens is because it's relatively cheap (much cheaper than a manned project would be) and doesn't involve a whole lot of sacrifice for other priorities public funds have to cover on Earth.

The American public via their politicians have pretty consistently shown that the level of money NASA gets is more or less what they think it should be. To change that, you either need A) more money flowing into the federal budget through taxes (we see how well that's been going); B) To find more money in another part of the budget (plenty of options, but each one involves moral tradeoffs and pissing some segment of society off); or C) Some kind of focusing event that makes people accept a sudden, sustained increase in space funding (Sputnik, Gagarin and the Bay of Pigs worked the first time).

Outside those three things, there's little chance of selling another Apollo-level investment in manned spaceflight in the US. Fortunately though, space agencies around the world and their political allies have gotten smarter lately and started to realize that international cooperation might be a viable way to spread costs on future deep space missions. If so, we'll probably still have to wait a little while for a Mars landing, but not as long as we probably would for NASA or another agency working on their own.",NateCadet,2014-12-03 21:48:53

"It is far deeper than mere pessimism though.  There is even a ""giggle factor"" where many people in government don't even think this stuff is possible.  You should have seen the debate merely to get the FAA-AST created, where even today there are folks that think commercial spaceflight operations is still science fiction... in spite of the fact that it is a multi-billion dollar annual industry.  When Newt Gingrich talked about trying to sponsor legislation that would enable a lunar equivalent of the Homestead Act, he was ridiculed on Saturday Night Live with all of the other presidential candidates simply calling him stupid and even a lunatic for talking about people actually going to the Moon.  They didn't even really debate the actual substance of the proposal in the first place.

That is what I'm talking about here, about trying to get people to realistically think about space as being a real place as opposed to something you read about in science fiction novels.  It is why there has been not just little progress, but negative progress where a whole generation of kids think that the Apollo Moon landings never even happened in the first place.... because the agency which sent Neil Armstrong and Gene Cernan to the Moon is incapable of even sending astronauts to the ISS except on Russian hardware.

I wish it was different.  I wish there was a real goal of doing something in space, and more importantly a goal of having ordinary people like you and me be given the opportunity to go into space with something other than a lottery.  Space at the moment is a project that fuels congressional pork and something to do for the government, not a group of destinations that can really benefit mankind and in particular America.  It can be better, but I've been making that fight for decades now and NASA is **not** the agency to get mankind to Mars.  It simply is the wrong tool for the job.",rshorning,2014-12-04 09:56:50

I don't see this proposal sent out today having any more traction and likely will see about the same level of support as Richard Nixon's proposal for going to Mars.... by 1990.  24 years after manned missions to Mars was supposed to already be history, it is still another 20 years in the future.

I don't expect NASA will get this accomplished before my grandchildren die of old age.  For that matter, the last crewed spaceship to actually send people into space from America was funded from legislation sent to Congress by the Nixon administration.  That singular failure to follow up on anything since then doesn't give me much inspiration either.

Orion is impressive because it has survived two presidential administrations since it was originally conceived, and won't actually get used until yet another person becomes president... due to constitutional limits forcing them out of office no less.

It's also not considered large enough to be a habitation module for the trip to and from Mars. The Mars trip, if it ever happens, won't be until the mid 2030s. Basically, it's political hype. You have to be a first term president and give an ultimatum of landing of Mars *within a decade*. Anything further out is lost to political changes, cancellations, etc.

"I don't think the other redditor is necessarily an idiot, but they are ignorant about the subject at hand, as many people tend to be.  

You only need to have a simple understanding of physics in order to grasp that interstellar space travel is impossible for human beings.  Among a litany of problems, the necessary distance to travel to the nearest (which isn't even ideal) star system is too great.  This is nothing like the struggle for human flight, as that was still possible within the realm of physics.  For human beings to be able to travel to another star system some type of discovery that would completely alter our current understanding of physics would need to occur.  Unlike past generations, modern human beings have a rather firm grasp upon the fundamentals of physics, so it is highly unlikely that such a scientific paradigm shift will occur.

You don't have to take my word for it of course, as anyone with a solid knowledge of astronomy could easily tell you the same thing, unless their head is filled with delusions of science fiction, or fringe scientific dreams.

Edit:  I took the time to find this for you.  Since you won't listen to me, a nobody, feel free to read what a [big somebody said about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qccer/i_am_neil_degrasse_tyson_ask_me_anything/c3wh5vo?context=3).  It looks like he got a lot of shit from ignorant redditors too, but I think people tend to react negatively towards having their fantasies dashed.  ",dyingfast,2014-12-04 07:55:09
"I wasn't even going to follow the discussion any further, but I just cannot hold the fallacies.

First of all, with all respects to Neil DeGreasse Tyson, he is nobody. I think you misunderstood what I wanted to mean with *you are a nobody*. It means that you are a person for the present, as anyone else, and thus you cannot make statements for the future, because you, and anyone else, do nothing about what is going to be discovered or what is going to be change because by definition NOBODY KNOWS IT AT THE MOMENT.
You are nobody, I am nobody, Tyson is nobody. 

------------------------------------ 

Second, what really infuriates me is the tendency of people to point OPINIONS of professionals as proofs. It is called fallacy of authority and it is a very bad argument. Can Tyson show me real data and studies that shows that in one thousands years nobody will come out with something new which allows the humankind to leave the Solar System? Protip: He can't. So as far as he cannot do it, he is giving his OPINION, not facts.

To show how stupid is the fallacy of authority let me put some examples:

Sir Isaac Newton. Comparing Newton with Tyson in *open minds* for their age is, with due respect for the last, almost insulting because Newton reinvented our approach to physics thinking completely out of the box for that time and postulated physics theories that have last centuries, while Tyson has done nothing comparable in magnitude. Isaac Newton was convinced that the light was composed of particles, and that the wave theories were wrong and stupid (and he made fun many times of the physicist who defended the wave theories). He died yelling that the light wasn't a wave and that nobody would proof the opposite ever.

If in the Reddit of the XVII century, anyone would have asked him: ""Hello, Mr Newton, thank you for doing the AMA. When will we be able to speak almost instantly with people standing in the antipode of us?*, he would have answered in a heartbeat ""**NEVER**"". 


Let me introduce you now Albert Einstein, albeit you probably know who is he. In the world of this man, the physics was already *solved*. Literally, people thought that they could not learn anything new, because with the Newton laws and some of the latest discoveries, only a few questions remained unanswered. Almost all the experiments could be explained with their theories. They had the best grasp of the fundamental physics and a huge shift in the theory won't ever happen. Albert Einstein is the man who, literally, took down the most fixed, reliable, intuitive concepts in the physics, such as the universality of the time, and modify them in such a way that nobody before him would have never, ever imagined. 

This man refused during his whole life to believe the quantum theory. The man who revolutionized the physic of his time could not accept that his own mind was to narrow to understand the new world that the new experiments showed. And there were experiments! Real data! And he couldn't believe. He even worked in the photoelectric effect, which is one of the starting points of the quantum theory! Planck, the man who solved the black body radiation paradox and introduced the concept of quanta of light said ""This is only a mathematical object, a trick to solve the problem, because it is not possible for something like this to exist in our world"", but that is another story. Einstein could not believe that the reality was not deterministic no matter how many proofs they showed to him, he always tried to find the *unknown variables*.

If in the Reddit of the XX century, anyone would have asked him: ""Hello, Mr Einstein, thank you for doing the AMA. When do you think we will be able to use the concept provided by the quantum theory to develop technology*, he would have answered in a heartbeat ""**NEVER**"". Nowadays, the concepts of the quantum theory are literally everywhere and our modern technology is based on it. Einstein would have said that the chips in a computer are completely impossible to ever occur, for example.


In summary, when somebody points me the opinion of a professional or expert who is giving his opinion (because there is no data there, no theory, nothing, just an opinion) and try to pass it as a fact, it is mildly infuriating. 


------------------------------------ 

Third, and finally, if you are going to quote someone, at least try to understand what that person is saying.

Dr. Tyson said that with out CURRENT understanding of the space-time we would never be able to do it (which is not even correct, unless you can discard that ideas such as the gen ships won't be feasible even in 1000 years, which I consider that it is narrow minded), BUT he does not say that it is impossible. He just say that we cannot build tomorrow a rocket to travel to Orion, not that it is impossible to happen because with our CURRENT understanding of the physics it is not possible.

For everything else, I will just relate to the first [Clarke's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws):

&gt;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that ... something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

People like you, the physicist of the end XIX/early XX and, in part, Dr Tyson think that you are living *at the end of the path*, that nothing new will ever revolutionize the world and that only new small details are there to be found but we understand already the important part.  Because there is no way to say ""It is impossible"" if you don't think so. People along the whole history have always though the same. They always though that they were the last possible step in the evolution and that nothing big would ever change after them. People always felt entitled to think that they were the *special generations* of our specie.

Do you know how the gravity is related with the other three fundamental forces? Do you know what is the dark matter or energy? Do we know if those even exist? Hawking even  said recently that the black holes don't even exist as we know think we understand them. You look at any field and there are some serious questions to answer. Even more there are more important question which are not even thought yet. If you know any of those answers, please, go directly to Sweden to grab your Nobel prize.

We are developing sources of energy such as fusion which will change dramatically everything we know at the moment. Have you ever checked the warp motor theorized by some physicist in the NASA once they found the correct, optimized curvature field? Probably it is completely wrong and probably it will be to the future concepts as the Jule Verne's canon-shot-space-train is to the actual design of a spaceship.  We do not even know how to derive our concept of gravity in harmony with our other concepts (twin particles and quantum teleportation are two examples of direct confrontation of two of our main actual theories) and people is already saying what we will be able to do and what we won't. Amazing. Just simply amazing. 

We cannot even know how much knowledge we lack and you go and say that something is impossible. What a bold statement for a Mr Nobody of the current time.

Regardless, it seems like the entirety of this lengthy post was just to state that, ""Anything is possible in the future, because things in the future are unknown.""  This moronic logic of yours essentially qualifies the future and technology as God, an entity of some sort through which anything we dream of is possible.  You are practically praying to technology for answers to the illogical.  Well that isn't how science works and there are actual boundaries to what man is capable of through technology.

How do you mean?,ContiX,2014-12-04 06:40:18
"You start with a mission, and a political commitment (which is by no means a guarantee, but it gives you something to go on).  Like ""land humans on the moon in 10 years.""

(It's important the goal not be too far away, because political commitments become hard to sustain across decades.  POTUS will likely change every 8 years, and you need to be too far along for the new guy to say ""why am I carrying water for the previous rival administration?""  The political commitment doesn't even need to be a large amount of money, since a Mars mission over 10 years could probably fit in 20% of NASA's budget, but Congress dictates how NASA spends money, and they have to allocate NASA funds to pursue that goal, whatever the goal is.)

Then you say ""what is the critical technology we need to get there?""  You build that, and only that, and do the mission.

NASA is kind of building some interesting technology, and then finding ways to justify it[1], by saying ""hey, if we do a Mars mission some day, maybe we will use this.""

The Orion, however, is probably too small to accommodate 4-5 people for 6 months.  http://i.imgur.com/GJLNn6M.png  Less than 214 square feet of cabin space[2], so imagine 4 people sharing a 14x14 foot room.  A manned mission to Mars will require, at the minimum, room for daily exercise, and possibly even artificial gravity (whether that's by rotating the craft or attaching it to a tether).

[1] Heavy-lift launch is always a good idea.

[2] You can technically use the third dimension, meaning that you care about cubic feet, but look at the diagram, and see that you can't even stack two people up, and some of the floor space doesn't even allow one person to stand up.",danweber,2014-12-04 08:27:31

"In my short time on this Earth I've lived through about four proposed Manned Mars Missions, and not one of them made it past initial testing of the spacecraft. NASA Space Exploration Initiative of 1989 never got past a published report, Mars Direct ended with Robert Zubrin making a fool out of himself in front of a Congressional sub-committee, Venture Star was canceled after NASA failed to make composite cryo-tanks that worked, and the Orion launch tomorrow is just the leavings from the Vision for Space Exploration, which was essentially just Mike Griffin's PhD thesis which was little more than the words ""Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle"" typed over and over again. Hell, the Space Launch System (SLS) is almost identical to the proposed Ares IV, just with a smaller upper stage. 

Even if the Orion is successful (and it probably will be, there's nothing technically ground breaking about tomorrow's test flight), SLS still needs about half a billion dollars more from Congress to be completed. And you know, Congress just loves giving NASA budget increases.

You want to believe in the future of manned space exploration, stop waiting for NASA to build manned spacecraft, they haven't been great at for the last 40 years, what they are great at, what should be funded is robotic exploration. Its cheaper, NASA has tonnes (see what I did there?) of experience in it, and between Europa, Callisto, Ganymede, Titan, Enceladus, and Triton and countless undiscovered exo-planets, there's plenty of places that NASA could spend less money to make more groundbreaking discoveries.

As for Mars, SpaceX is already going there, and they're not waiting for Congress (well they are, but defense contracts are a lot more reliable).",YNot1989,2014-12-03 20:10:53

"There's an old documentary about Zubrin's ""Case for Mars,"" and in it Zubrin is testifying in front of a group of Congressman and he's basically berating them and by extension NASA for having never gotten around to going to Mars. Its abundantly clear by the end of the hearing that no one on the committee took him or his ideas seriously because of his behavior.",YNot1989,2014-12-04 13:54:16
"I agree with you that NASA is really good at unmanned missions.
I disagree that a private company like SpaceX could ever muster the trillions of dollars required for a manned Mars mission.... :(",hdboomy,2014-12-03 21:46:10

You have no idea what Elon is building.

His modular robotic manufacturing technology is the envy of the world. Tesla is dominating the electric market when everyone else is hemorrhaging money. His partnership (and part ownership) with Solar City and the Super Charger network combined with nation wide battery storage is a revolution in sustainable energy just waiting to happen. The Gigafactory is going up to double lithium battery production, by the time it's fully opperational we will probably be two more generations into advancing that field with either full lithium anodes and diodes or some carbon based solution. Either way we are talking about orders of magnitude more world wide storage capacity and density. And multiple factories are already in the works, seems like Elon can't get enough land.

SpaceX with Google are talking about creating a new standard platform for small form factor satellites deployed in mass in low earth orbit mesh networked constellations. Instead of big fat expensive sats in high orbit constant resupplies of upgrades could be provided by the soon to be partially reusable Falcon 9 stack. That means things like low latency satellite internet that can scale nearly infinitely for pennies per customer. Non-directional, planet wide. You can WoW with friends in Antarctica while you sip margaritas from the deck of your boat in the middle of the Caribbean, whatever.

SpaceX itself was created as a **Mars program**. You aren't reading that wrong the only reason SpaceX exists at all is because Elon want's to go to Mars personally. He is using is business and engineering acumen to make a profitable company to lower the price of orbit to achieve that goal, not to enrich himself. He has much better ways to enrich himself that I have already outlined, he is in **spend mode**. SpaceX is his greatest legacy. The gift of making us a multi-planet species, just because he can and nobody else is doing it. Not all capitalists only think of the bottom line, money is just the means to the end.

Elon barring any accidents or assassinations will be the most powerful man in the world. Within two decades, he able to move capital that only governments previously dreamed of, literally moving heaven and Earth where ever and however he damn well feels like.

Go ahead and use the remindme bot, mark my words, [Elon will be Elon](http://imgur.com/a/yhvDH).

Edit: Check out /r/spaceX if you are interested in learning more. In about a week SpaceX is returning the first stage of the Falcon 9 going to the International Space Station and landing it under power vertically on a barge or as Elon says [""Autonomous spaceport drone ship""](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/536262624653365248).

That's not even mention Skylon and Firefly, both possible breakthroughs in rocket technology from other companies.",Forlarren,2014-12-03 22:41:31

"[Crab mentality.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality)

Elon isn't some sort of god, he's just the example of what man can do when he puts his mind to something productive instead of being a self centered cunt.

"What makes you think SpaceX is more qualified to build rockets for a Mars mission? They have zero experience with manned flight, and their planned heavy lift rocket carries substantially less than the already complete SLS.",steriosterio,2014-12-04 02:45:37
"&gt; SpaceX is more qualified to build rockets for a Mars mission?

Because they are hiring all the talent. Logos on sides of buildings don't make things, engineers in buildings do. Engineering experience resides in people, not corporate structures. Corporate structures only store financial experience.

I'm sure some day SpaceX will be shit too, probably when Elon dies. But for right now, they are our new Skunk Works, and everyone has to start somewhere.

&gt; already complete SLS.

[Citation needed.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System)

Don't bother with that citation you aren't going to find it.

Construction only began this year and nothing is planned to fly until 2018. There is nothing ""complete"" about SLS. It's not designed at all for reusability. In fact it waists four SSME's per flight. Sure we have a small stockpile but that will last what? Three-four flights? Oh silly me, asking you things, you don't don't know any facts.",Forlarren,2014-12-04 10:10:26
"What the fuck, this is the preachiest shit I've seen on here in a while. You talk about Elon Musk like he's some sort of God and completely ignore any negative points.

Seems as this is a thread about space, I'll focus on what you said about SpaceX. What makes you think that they can go to Mars but NASA can't? They've only made a single orbital spacecraft. That's it. It's just a plain old regular lifter like any other, and have never taken a human into space, yet you believe them wholeheartedly when they say that they will put people on Mars before NASA and create colonies. They have nothing to back up that statement yet, so I see no reason to believe it.

NASA on the other hand *has* shown it can put people in space and land then on another world, and they have taken part in building the international space station. Plus there's the fact that they're launching a test flight of the actual spacecraft they plan to go to mars with, less than an hour from now. These are all valuable experience that would help with sending humans to Mars, and I think at the moment I'd much rather believe NASA than SpaceX. ",space_guy95,2014-12-04 03:51:21
"The reason they can go to Mars and NASA can't is Congress.  Musk's primary (really ONLY) point is that the Trillions needed to go to Mars are mostly the cost of getting off Earth and his first step is to FIX that.  This is what the Shuttle was supposed to do in the 1970's but CONGRESS.  (look at STS history 1970 to 1980)  MUSK can decide where to buy a flange based on what he needs for a flange, not whose district has the flange manufacturers.",Oknight,2014-12-04 05:25:29

"The point is that they haven't proven their capabilities so you're just taking their word for it. Of course they're going to talk the talk since their contracts and profits depend on it, but there's no evidence to back it up.

"Exactly right. What private space companies do is fill in the voids that NASA vacates as they move on to their next goals. Think of NASA as Lois and Clark exploring the west, and private space as the railroads that came after, offering regular transport to where the explorers first went years before. When NASA ended the shuttle program, private space came in to resupply the ISS and launch sattelites, while NASA planned to tackle the next step, Mars (note that what they intend to do doesn't necessarily fall in line with what they CAN do because of the government, which is where their legislative affairs office comes into play).

"You're right but even if they had another half a billion to spend there is one huge issue that many don't think of. Even if we got the rocket and crew to Mars, NASA really isn't developing a system that allows for ongoing travel to Mars. Because of this, we run the risk of landing on Mars, patting ourselves on the back and then not going back for 200 years.

Among reasons why are we should have launched years ago to begin the tedious and difficult challenge of changing the delta V of a large ""Plan B"" type asteroid enough to maneuver it into cis-lunar orbit, NASA barely has the resources to concentrate on this mission alone and they're expected to be doing this as a side project while ultimately working on the Mars mission, and most importantly, more and more people within academia and NASA itself are questioning the usefulness of the mission itself relative to the big picture.

It is really a shame that modern space exploration seems very timid and slow. When the Apollo missions were ongoing it must have seemed like the beginning of a new space age, but it never really came. It was more like the end of one. It feels like by rights we should've had a manned Mars mission in the '80s. That would've been technically possible if there had been sufficient political will behind it, right? By now we should be going further.

But now the actual Mars mission, if it does actually happen, will happen when I'm in my late 40s. By the time I die I'll probably only have seen what I might've seen by now in my 20s if we had just kept going. It's like we've been set back a lifetime's worth of exploration.

"Cool and pays back into the economy in the form of new technology that the private sector will utilize. Think about how the Space Race has helped the economy now that satellite technology is a major part of our lives.

NASA is one of the few government agencies estimated to put more money back into the economy than is spent on them.",Billryethebreadguy,2014-12-03 20:01:26

"A lot of tax money is wasted on pointless endeavors, hell we've spent millions on pointless university studies that could be done for a fraction of the cost. (Do you know what's in pigeon shit? Would you pay 50,000 to find out? How about the mating habits of squirrels for a couple hundred grand?)

NASA isn't a charity, they do actual research with real results that end up in the market and part of the economy. If every other government agency paid back into the market like NASA we wouldn't be worried about government spending. Considering the jobs that get created from NASA derived technology, I'd hesitate to call it wasteful spending, and this coming from someone who hates government spending period. Instead though we let off tens of thousands of highly qualified engineers in just the last few years alone, all because we'd rather spend money on stupid ivory tower projects or unnecessary military projects that don't deliver. (Like the F-35, what a boondoggle)

Edit: that F35 project btw is in the hundred billion dollar range over-budget, that's more than 5 years the annual budget for all of NASA",Billryethebreadguy,2014-12-03 20:26:51
"Those expensive studies done by universities pay for their upkeep. Sure, you could go to a private company for cheaper, but the university study will help fund a graduate student to do further research and a professor to teach a class on something valuable, and better lab space for students.

"**Article summary:** 

---


&gt;* Despite NASA’s excitement, the pace of development—driven by Congressional funding—means that the next Orion test flight won’t happen for nearly three years.

&gt;* The Apollo missions had to manage reentry heat up to 5,000 degrees; a Mars mission may well test 6,000 degrees.

&gt;* Future Orion missions will be powered by the Space Launch System, the largest rocket in NASA history.

Investments in the moon program gave us some amazing electronics. A similar investment in robotics will pay huge dividends for terrestrial technology. 

Of course this will get down-voted because everyone is enamoured with landing on another planet (and pretty much no other reason), but I'm telling you, a hundred robotic probes, working 24/7 will give us way more new information than a fragile human will. ",photolouis,2014-12-03 18:12:50

People want to see people on Mars because it does a million and 1 times more then what you think people want it for. don't fool yourself into some stupid fucking delusion that we only want to go there for ""special effects.""

Basically you are undermining the impact of a *human* seeing these things with their very own eyes, as well as the *human* achievement of setting *human* footprints on another freaking planet.

The sad truth is that there is no political will to properly fund NASA to be able to launch a mars mission by the 2030s.   Fifteen years ago they said we'd be heading to mars 15 years from now (thirty years back then).   This is just more of the same.  It is easy to make promises if some nameless people in the future have the responsibility to fulfill them.  ,Bifurcated_Kerbals,2014-12-03 18:44:25

I have no doubt that it's efficient. I guess I just figured we'd be able to make something more along the lines of a beefed up shuttle that would land on a runway at this point.,New_Car_Wrecked,2014-12-04 04:26:28
"We can, it's just crazy expensive and really difficult to maintain a reusable re-entry craft. At one point we had five space shuttles, but the fleet never flew more than nine missions a year and cost almost two billion per mission. Those were only ever to to low earth orbit.. although I think one of the Hubble servicing missions was farther but was a a stretch and major risk. You need a huge amount of fuel to get to the moon... they figure spending that fuel to deliver equipment to to the moon rather than lugging wings and landing gear back and forth is a better use of the budget. An actual shuttle is a lot sexier though heh.",im-not-rick-moranis,2014-12-04 04:49:55
"Could they use ISS or a similar station as a pit-stop? I think this type of multi-part mission would be the way of the future for long expeditions.

"Yup, definitely. Building the long range crafts in orbit around the Earth or Moon using multiple launches is a major goal. A manned inter-planetary ship would be so big that it would have to be assembled gradually in orbit like the ISS has. Getting things to orbit cheaply is like the Holy Grail of manned space flight at the moment. Well, it always has been really... that's why a space elevator would be so great.",im-not-rick-moranis,2014-12-04 05:29:38
"That means extra weight. Just moving a kilogram through the atmosphere requires a tremendous amount of energy (read: fuel). Adding a whole slew of landing gears and mechanisms means an extra ton or two.

"Thank you, I think that's much cooler than going to Mars. Asteroid mining could make space profitable, unlike Mars, which would be a huge money pit. The technical challenges are more interesting, in my opinion, and once it's established we'd have facilities and infrastructure in space that would serve as stepping stones to further traveling.

There are [several billionaires](http://www.planetaryresources.com/) wanting to get into asteroid mining, so there's probably going to be a partnership between them and NASA, and that will happen much sooner than anyone going to Mars.",mutatron,2014-12-03 19:03:22

Nearly all federal education programs are funded through the annual appropriations process. The appropriations for Education totaled $67 billion, or 6 percent, of the $1.1 trillion in total appropriations funding in 2014.

Military was about 50 percent of the total funding... Are you saying 6 percent is enough?",txtrav,2014-12-03 19:58:46

Fucked.

Six days into what should be the greatest two months of my life, and it's turned into a nightmare.

I don't even know who'll read this. I guess someone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now. For the record . . . I didn't die on Sol 6. Certainly the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can't blame them.

'Cause I'll surely die here. Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I did.

Let's see . . . where do I begin?

The Ares Program. Mankind reaching out to Mars to send people to another planet for the very first time and expand the horizons of humanity blah, blah, blah. The Ares 1 crew did their thing and came back heroes. They got the parades and fame and love of the world.

Ares 2 did the same thing, in a different location on Mars. They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee when they got home.

Ares 3. Well, that was my mission. Okay, not mine per se. Commander Lewis was in charge. I was just one of her crew. Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew. I would only be ""in command"" of the mission if I were the only remaining person.

Quite honestly if the US is able to get more businesses interested in space and or we get some new start ups in the states mining asteroids (there is a mission NASA is doing to bring an asteroid and mine it orbit around the moon) The economic benefits would be astronomical!,BagelBenny,2014-12-03 22:36:16

So build a spacestation with provisions for at least 300 days. 

This solves 2 problems - first, the nutrition of the astronauts. Secondly, from the spacestation, they could launch the crafts that can land on Mars and use robots to build and secure an infrastructure. 

And finally, if the spacestation becomes operational, you can send shuttles to change the residents of the station.

I feel like the concept so far has always been to go to a planet, but no one considered building a spacestation first around that planet, to facilitate the whole process.",makz242,2014-12-04 01:16:00

Nor is it fitting that such a historic step be taken by representatives of only a small fraction of the human species. But a cooperative venture among the United States, Russia, Japan, the European Space Agency—and perhaps other nations, such as China—might be feasible in the not too distant future. The international space station will have tested our ability to work together on great engineering projects in space.

(...)

According to solemn treaty, signed in Washington and Moscow on January 27, 1967, no nation may lay claim to part or all of another planet. Nevertheless—for historical reasons that Columbus would have understood well—some people are concerned about who first sets foot on Mars. If this really worries us, we can arrange for the ankles of the crew members to be tied together as they alight in the gentle Martian gravity.""

"Given current technology a mission to Mars would take almost 3 years.  Do you realize how much air, food and water it would take to support a crew of at least six people?  Do you realize how much fuel it would take to get them there and back?  And how many tons of radiation shielding would we have to send up there to protect them from deep space.  And then when they get there how are they going to land? More importantly, how are they going to launch back into space?  Also, who knows what the effects of three years in a small, confined space would have on the crew.  Not to mention all the problems that would come with three years spent in zero gravity.  Sorry, but given our current level of technology it would be a lot easier, cheaper and more merciful to shoot six astronauts.  Finding a better propulsion system is just the first step and we are nowhere near that.  Maybe in forty or fifty years time. But probably more like a hundred.",DSpatriot,2014-12-03 18:58:32

"We don't have the technology to create a self-supporting closed system for habitation in space.  I'm fully familiar with the ISS and oxygen generation through electrolysis, carbon scrubbing blah blah.  ISS still needs oxygen and water from Earth.  There are no huge gardens on the ISS to provide food or create oxygen. There is a reason for that.  What you don't realize is how incredibly difficult if not impossible it would be for us to reach Mars and return given our current technology. And there is no way to test the effect of three years in space in small, cramped quarters other than to put someone on the ISS for three years straight and see if they don't go bananas.  But all of that pales in comparison to loss of bone density and muscle atrophy due to zero gravity. After a year in space the astronauts won't be in good shape to walk around the surface of Mars.  And all of that pales even more when compared to the problem of deep space radiation.  We simply don't know what to do about right now other than to build a some gigantic spacecraft with meters and meters of super dense shielding.  How much would it cost to get all that lead up there?  For us to go to Mars and have anyone come back alive we need revolutions in our technology. The first is a revolution in a propulsion system.  The trip is not feasible with chemical rockets. People have theories about ion drives and all that but nothing real and practical has been built.  Second we need to develop a self-sustaining, closed system that can support human life.  That's even harder than a faster propulsion system.  Third we need a way to protect humans from deep space radiation that doesn't involve us building a small moon.  Fourth, and hardest, is that we need a way to simulate gravity so that the astronauts are actually able to do their jobs and remain healthy.  Blind optimism won't get us to Mars.  Or anywhere else.  I expect we will reach Mars at some point but not for several decades if not centuries.",DSpatriot,2014-12-04 10:26:28

On a comet, not an asteroid!

There's another one I'm forgetting (at least one), but my point is more that space exploration happens routinely enough that people have no idea of the sort of advances we've been making.

Rosetta is rad, but it's... not really any reason to assume that a gigantic space agency that receives a billion dollars a year more funding than the ESA (Europe), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japanese), DLR (Germany), and the CNSA (China) combined is somehow a has-been in space exploration. If NASA doesn't have the funding, experience, and brainpower to do it, *nobody* does.

"This will probably get buried, but this was announced a while ago. We've known for some time that one major goal of the Orion program was to send Americans to Mars. It's not the first time manned missions to mars have been planned for 20 years in the future. See [Planned Missions &gt; 21st Century here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars).

This isn't even the soonest *currently* planned mission to Mars. The [Inspiration Mars Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_mission_to_Mars) has one planned for 2018.

IMO, chances are slim that the 2018 mission will fly. I'm also inclined to say that the Orion mission has pretty slim chances of being taken to completion, but this is closer than humanity has ever come before and definitely worth getting VERY excited about.

"The problem is that the delay means anything you wanted done would be many times slower with a machine. This means it would take weeks if not months to do basic tasks that a human can do in a single day. And as was shown many times in the past, if you get a problem with the gear the entire mission is for naught.
We run machines not because we prefer it, but because we wanted them to take most of the early risks. Now that we know the environment and what to expect, we can send humans with a reasonable expectation of them surviving. This isn't Star Trek where you just send men and women to planets you know nothing about.
",VallenValiant,2014-12-03 20:46:47
"I fail to see how a 14 minute lag turns simple tasks into a process that would take months?

How long do you think we would be able to keep people on mars?  With proper supplies we could keep machines doing whatever we wanted them to do nearly indefinitely with zero chance of losing anyones life and it would cost orders of magnitudes less.",ppcpunk,2014-12-03 20:59:21
"We haven't been able to keep machines running indefinitely. The recent comet landing mission, for example, had to be concluded early when it wasn't getting enough sunlight to recharge its batteries.

I can't help but perceive that you have unusually high expectations of current machine technology. The robots are just not yet good enough.",VallenValiant,2014-12-03 21:16:48
"We never designed or tried to do anything like that, not shocking.

We have also never sent a mass deployment of machines to one location either.  

You can't just say ""it's not good enough yet"" what exactly isn't good enough?  We have had a rover on mars that far exceeded it's mission length.  Imagine what we could do if we sent machines that could support other machines and do repairs/maintenence.  

Robots are not good enough?  Are you crazy?  I'm being serious, have you watched how it's made before?  Robots are fucking amazing these days.",ppcpunk,2014-12-03 22:23:41
"Yes, robots are amazing, and I love them. Please don't misunderstand me, I am not against the use of robots for space exploration.
However, your view that we shouldn't try to send people to Mars for cost and safety concerns is rather... not popular. I understand if you just want to save money, in which case we should have no Space exploration at all. On the other hand Mars landing would be the very first time humans have landed on an actual planet beyond Earth itself. To achieve it safely would mean another step forwards to our expansion outside Earth. Further we needed to develop new Space Suits anyway; the current suits are fine under Moon's gravity, but on Mars they would be too heavy.

And really, as far as safety is concerned, everyone involved know the risks. No one is being forced to go to Mars. More people kill themselves climbing Mt Everest every year. It's not like we are sending unwilling conscripts against their will.",VallenValiant,2014-12-03 23:45:40

"Ok well I'm not at all interested in wasting money and resources, and we very well know we can send a man to mars.  What in the fuck would the point of that actually be?

We could send a man/men/a few people to mars and get them back home in 30/40 years maybe just to see if we can do it?

"This OP-supplied headline is woefully inaccurate. There is no official NASA manned mission to Mars. Everybody whining that NASA shouldn't send people to Mars can rest calmly, because it's never going to happen unless the political climate in the US changes drastically, and even then it won't happen for another 15-20 after that happens. The chances of a manned NASA mission to Mars are very small over a timeframe of at least 30 years.

It's not even certain that they'll be able to finish the Space Launch System at this rate. They only have enough money to test Orion **once every four years**. The [average NASA budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA) from 1965 through 1969 was $35 billion in 2014 dollars, compared to $17 billion in 2014.

The upfront cost of invading Iraq was enough to pay NASA's current budget for 100 years, and the extended costs, including all future costs for veterans, would pay for an Apollo era NASA budget for 170 years.

Elon Musk's total fortune is about 4 months worth of Apollo era NASA spending.

However, it is very possible that the asteroid mission will be accomplished, because there's money in that. Most likely Orion will see fairly good use as an asteroid rendezvous platform, and it might be used for helping set up a robotic asteroid mining operation.",mutatron,2014-12-03 18:48:08

"Manned spaceflight has *never* been to go out and find science and bring it back. I mean, the manned missions to mars are not going there to look for life, or do really do anything of inherent value. That's not the point. 

Manned spaceflight does two very important things. 

**Reason One**, is get people (read: young students) excited in space and science. People don't get as excited over rovers as they do about real humans. This sounds cheesy, but history has shown it to be true. In the 60's the US had huge public excitement for the Apollo programs, and 15 years later we had a *massive* spikes in students graduating from the sciences with desires and dreams of technologies inspired in their youth by the Apollo missions. There's no coincidence that in the late 1970s and mid 1980s, the US transitioned from a standard manufacturing nation, into a nation known for innovations and technological revolutions. The emergence of the internet, personal computing, and the countless wireless technologies all happened in the US within a decade of this spike of motivated college graduates, and multiple surveys and studies down over the years have shown that in the 80s most science graduates stated the Apollo program was what sparked their desire to study the sciences in school. 

**Reason Two**, human spaceflight forces the development of human-centered technology, which translates into technologies that improve the lives of humans on Earth. Sending a robot probe to Mars, or sending a rover to Venus... honestly, that doesn't do shit for the humans back home. Even the science they gather, while nice to know, doesn't *really* change lives. No one's life was bettered by the fact that NASA knows the elemental make up of a rock on Mars that a robot drilled into. NASA building more probes means spending a billion dollars making a machine, and making instruments for machines, but it's dead end research. Researching better probes for Venus doesn't help anyone, and the science they get about Venus doesn't really do anything. It's nice to know the content of Venus's soil, but that science doesn't change a single thing or matter to any normal people on Earth. Meanwhile, send people to you moon and now you are building technologies that **humans** will be using. NASA is forced to develop water filtration systems, radiation shielding, new ways to recycle greenhouse materials, new clothing materials for humans, new ways of storing food...

You say human spaceflight costs more than robotic spaceflight, but you're ignoring what each of them get us in the end. 

You seem to think the ""space data"" is all that matters, when in reality regular people get nothing out of that. People want new advancements in technology that better their lives, and it's really only the human spaceflight that creates things and spurs developments that literally revolutionizes entire economies and improve cultural habits.",Namika,2014-12-03 18:54:54

"The moon landing officially ended the space race, America achieved a goal once thought impossible and started an era where two superpowers that a few years earlier were at each other's throats, instead began to unite to honour the spirit of human endeavour, and further their goals.

But today, a new race has begun, the bar has been raised, and it doesn't matter who makes it there first, we just need the evidence that continued, sustainable travel is doable and we that can push ourselves further than we ever did before, both with endurance and unification. The prospect for countries to come together as they did in the 70s, USA, Russia, China, India, the UK, and independent contractors, not for greed or war against each other, is enormous. The technology that could spring from this and benefit us is off the scale.

I hope that within fifty years a representative astronaut from each of the major players will be able to travel to Mars, see the airlocks open and shake hands with each other. While we on Earth look up and ask ""where next?""

Are you saying the journey is purely physcological? A test of our might?",Slight0,2014-12-04 05:16:07
"It is a necessary step in the progression of our species. What economic or scientific benefit did Columbus' voyage have? What it did achieve was show that it was possible to reach America by ship and so more and more people made the journey and eventually settled in the Americas.

That ended up being a pretty good idea economically speaking! I'm not saying it will be as easy to obtain a profit from a base on Mars but the research that could be achieved by having people on the ground for long term missions would be invaluable.

But I also believe that there are more than just physical benefits to this. Humanity must spread out from our planet at some point in our future in order to preserve the species. There are plenty of things that could still wipe out human life or atleast set us back to the stone age, not least ourselves. Having a presence on other planets that is self sufficient is crucial to surviving that.

Not to mention the bonding as a world that I believe will occur once we have joint teams cooperating on another planet, even humans born on another planet in time.",Dargish,2014-12-04 05:34:40
"&gt; What economic or scientific benefit did Columbus' voyage have? 

Well the discovery of new land has massive potential benefits for those who seek them. Columbus also discovered America on accident, his goal was to ""find a direct water route west from Europe to Asia"". (of course columbus was arguably not the one who found it first, yada yada)

Our voyage to mars is intentional, we already know very much about it. There is still things to uncover, no doubt, but columbus's voyage and the journey to mars are pretty dissimilar I feel.

&gt;There are plenty of things that could still wipe out human life or at least set us back to the stone age, not least ourselves. Having a presence on other planets that is self sufficient is crucial to surviving that.

While you have a point, that having a presence on other planets has many survival benefits among other benefits, mars is almost assuredly not that planet. As far as all we know about it suggests so far. It will cost us a lot just to maintain a transient presence there.

&gt;Not to mention the bonding as a world that I believe will occur once we have joint teams cooperating on another planet, even humans born on another planet in time.
